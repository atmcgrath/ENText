1KNOW too well the melancholly reaSon of your preSent silence, and do not preSume to interrupt it, or desire you to write till perfectly convenient; but the consideration of this day’s beginning a New Tear,, induces me to Send you my best wishes (not my compliments) on that occasion.

I petitioned that your valuable life might be prolonged beyond the common date of humanity; that your fen- \ sibility might never more be wounded by the loSs of a friend; that you might enjoy uninterrupted health and every Species of happineSs.
THE CORRESPONDENTS.	5
To * *.
T HAVE no Suitable return for your most kind wish. The Second article includes every thing; and is the best condolance I have received ; for on theSe occasions little to the purpoSe can be Said.
As to the rest, when I enjoy health I. am thankful; but there arc not many Species of happineSs that I can enjoy. People in advanced life, as their connexions dissolve, grow indifferent, and find their attachment to the world de-creafe daily: the few pleaSures they can relish may generally be Safely afforded them. Your correspondence is numbered among the few that 1 regard : you will continue it to me, and accept my Sincere acknowledgments.

Casting my eyes round, finding mySelf in a very comfortable retreat—independent of the world— tri'pYmgtolerable health,—a few friends still Spared to me—O Memory., thought I, what but thy annihilation is wanting to my happinefs! then I could enjoy theSe various blessings without the re-fiedlion of their uncertainty, without the dread of their Sudden loSs.—Here I broke off my meditation, and endeavoured to confirm my tranquillity, by communicating this account of it, which 1 know will afford a generous Satisfaction to your benign heart; a fatisfadion A 4	that

TH E Substance of your letter is a very agreeable leffon in moral phi-lofophy; but I wish you had omitted the conclusion. How often must I repeat that you owe me no obligation ?

Why any refpefi ^ the ut-mojirejpefi^ my mojl devoted?

WHEN I first proposed this friendly correspondence, you pleaded inability to maintain it; upon which, I promised never to write or require long or corred: letters. A few artleSs lines, expressive of health, of friendship, of my thing but study and affe6tation,was all that I requested from yon, or gave you to exped from me.
I established at the fame time a very unexceptionable conveyance‘y and promised to return your letters: in short, according to my notion of things, I removed every objedion that diffidence, discretion, or delicacy could Suggest.
Your letter intimates the contrary. You are now diffatisfied becauSc there

He drew tears from me without Speaking a word, in that Scene where his mother urges him to acknowledge himSelf her Son I and he with infinite emotion declines the explanation. TheSe tears were all I shed. I am Seldom much affeifled by pompous declamation or high-wrought pashon ; and the poet had well nigh forfeited my pity for Mandane^ by painting her So Savage in her revenge.
I waspieaSed with two circumstances in the exhibition of this piece, which I
never

never remember to have Seen before ; one was, the stage being wholly covered with green cloth, which appeared quite proper, as the Scene lies without doors ; and prevented the abSurdity of bringing carpets to fall upon:—the other was. Seeing Mrs. 'Xates., in a Sup-poSed agony of terror, fall motionleSs to the ground without assistance.— The audience in general applauded this manoeuvre ; and Seemed Sensible how much better an cffedl it had then her being caught by attendents, whoSe unmeaning faces would probably have Spoiled ' the Scene.

Your pardon is undoubtedly signed, Sealed, and delivered ;—but I cannot greatly admire the epithet you bestow on m.e, and must beg leave to disclaim it.

Yours very sincerely.
THE correspondents, %'J
to *.
The field may be large, and the harvest great; yet the labourer may not have strength to reap it. But this is not an apology; for I enter very cheerfully upon my talk.
My theatrical taste, then, (without farther preface) has undergone Several revolutions. When I was about half my preSent age, I admired nothing but pantomime, and the agile tricks of Harlequin, though, at the Same time, prompted by childish vanity, I affefted to deSpiSe them. Soon after that period, my taste really altered. Romeo and Alexander became my heroes, I was pleaScd with alternate sighing and storming; and the most extravagant Scenes B2	of
\
28	. THE CORRESPONDENTS,
of the most extravagant tragedies appeared to me the noblest and most delightful. Weaned from this folly,- !, took a strong fancy to muftcal pieces,^on account of performing tliem on my own instruments; then aScending, as .1 thought, a full Scale in the climax of refinement, nothing would pleaSe me but the Italian opera : this, however, was a short-liv’d passion ; and was Succeeded by a fondneSs of the historical drama, and thofe plays that are uSually classed under the title oigenteel comedy ' and theSe, with a few exceptions, continue my favouriteentertainments. Regarding the theatres as the mirror of human lifej I prefer Such pieces as resse<st in my notions the most agreeable representations of it: from hence arifes my admiration of ShakeSpeare. I have no

Now, if to this {orntmardy critic should wittily objedt, that Shake-Speare created many imaginary heingSy I will readily allow that, becauSe it does not affedl this charadler.

T WAS astonished this morning at hearing that you went away So early.
'	I thought at least you would have staid
dinner, and wanted to make excuSes for my defettion last night. Shall I Say it was on your accounta bad compliment indeed, but I really fancied you Seemed under restraint. You were So very silent,
' and the rest So very talkative, that in short I grew tired ; and after pleading engagement, could not decently return.
Let ine hope for a line to-morrow. -Were you well entertained.? I thought Garrick as great as ever. Adieu.

XT'ES, ''my Lord, I was extremely -®- well entertained: but (pardon me for returning yom compliment')vt2^s much happier after your departure; not merely on account of restraint, but had you not withdrawn,! had lost one of the highest pleasures a Sensible mind can enjoy, which is, hearing the praiSes of thoSe it values. Some company that Sat near us, 1 don’t know who they were, but the moment you left the box they began to Speak of you ... and .. No ... not one word shall I repeat. I remember your caution, and will ever “ beware of flattery.” Sufficient for me that I heard theSe praiSes: they were honest and judicious, doing infinite credit to thoSe who bestowed them, and giving exquisite pleaSure to your Friend.

There was a little error in the beginning of your letter—but excuSablc, considering how late we converSed— I called at * yesterday, and heard that jou intended them a visit on Monday.

that I foreSee this letter will be nothing but a string of melancholly refitdlions.

The loSs of fortune, or indeed any diSaster that affedls one’s Self alone,leaves many refourccs. There is a moderation to be shewn which enables one calmly to bear the Suffer^ ing, or a noble firmneSs which raiSes one above compassion. The natural vanity of the human heart will Sometimes conSole us in adversity. Selfadmiration is often a powerful comforter, but wholly ineffedual against the stroke which lays one who loved us in the dust. We are then awed by humility. We call to mind the good qualities of the deceaSed, which “ brighten as they take their flight i’" ourown shrink- from the comparison, D 6	and

and we ar« ready to enquire why we should be yet favoured with an existence of which they are deprived. Again, though wc put SelfishneSs out of the question, and the delight, never more to be known, which their friendship afforded, yet still we find cauSes enough to justify unceaSing regret. la the words of an admired author, “ We consider, with afflictive anguish, the pain we may unthinkingly have given ' them, and now cannot alleviate; and the losses we may have cauSed, and

If we add to this the ressedfion, that they were Summoned from a state of being in which they were uSeful, and in which they would gladly have continued longer, it increafes our trouble to its highest degree,since almost every event, 'and even the most pleasing events, may revive their idea, with all the bitterneSs of compassionate grief.

Your letter which came yesterday awakened me from a very pleasing meditation on the riSe, progreSs, and ' preSent state of our friendship, in which 1 had concluded it was established on So Solid a basis,- that neither time or chance (one accident excepted) could ever destroy it; and thus I argued the matter:
Friendship

Friendship between two perSons of the siime Sex, though extremely eafy to be formed, is liable to dissolution by a thouSand accidents, from which ours is Secure. Sometimes a difference in taste, Sometimes too great a similarity, Sometimes interest, and Sometimes love, will unite the Sacred knot. Friend-' ship between thoSe of differing Sex, is harder to form and to preServe. Put consanguinity out of the question, and where will you find your friends ? Single or married, old or ycung, if they are of equal age, their Sentiment is not friendship .... it is either too coldy or too h§t. Again, if their age differs considerably, their tastes will, in general, be too opposite. Will a young man Seek for animated pleafure in matronly conversation ? Can a matron

Let us SuppoSe that on the'ground of long acquaintance, astridl and more particular friendship is formed, between an old man tolerably free from the vices of his age, and a young lady still freer from the foibles of hers. We ought to SuppoSe, that they are both diS-engaged from the conjugal tie, and their Sentiments should be pretty much alike upon all Subjedls. We will allow tlie lady to fancy herjelf in Some re-Spedls the inferior, parciculary in learn-

'' And now, pray what is your opinion of Such a connexion? Is it not well formed for duration ? Yea verily, and the rather for iti being of a gentle and placid kind, forming, as Somebody has

A FAB L E.
Once upon a time a poor widowed linnet (who unfortunately lost her mate in the hzxhz.xo\is, fiooting-feafon^ and who v^as not inclined to Seek another) found great difficulty in keeping the possession of her own Solitary nest. She had moreover the ill-fortuneto be entangled unawares in a net^ which proved mostly fatal to birds of her size; for the Smaller ones often crept through the meshes, while thoSe of Superior size and strength
could

could break the net and eScape. In this distreSs she applied to an eagle, that dwelt in xhtforeji adjacent, by whom she was ssightly known. This generous bird readily gave his assistance towards extricating her from the and afterwards continued to shew her great countenance and favour. Being un-uSed to the conversation of linnets, he thought her rather more cleaver than ,the generality of that Ipecies, and even imagined that she might prove an-agreeable acquaintance.
Every one that knows any thing of natural history knows that birds, like the human race, have many difi’erent degrees or classes of rank and precedence. The eagle, regardlefs of this, continued to visit the linnet, and in E 5	proceSs
J06 THE CORRESPONDENTS.
proceSs of time, desirous of more frequent iuterviews, became urgent with Jier to remove into his neighbourhood, among the birds of distindlion, alleging that she was extremely well qualified to figure in a higher Sphere,. The linnet knew better, but at length, with infinite jeludtance, she yielded to over-perSua-fiDn, and forsaking her peaceful thicket, was introduced by the eagle to the beau-monde of the feathered creation.
The novelty of the Scene engaged a ' little attention at first; but Soon, too Soon, the grand mistake became visible. The Ymntt/was net qualified. She could * not sing like the blackbird, she could not display the rich plumage of the goldfinch, she could not converSe with the deep-learned falcon, nor join in ' she music of the nightingale,

See the eagle, stis true, every day, but that.was no comfort, for every day brought new proofs that she was no companion for him. He wished her a hundred times at that distance, in which alone her merit appeared conSpicuous; but the removal was not without its difficulties. The birds whoSe Society she had left were now equally prejudiced against her, and she had neither Spirit nor interest to make new friends.^ Alas for the poor linnet: disregarded . by one party, diSowned by the other, she expired with mere shame and vex-i ation ; acquitting her benefador, and condemning only her own folly!

there is a singular, a very Jinking ingenuity in the construdtion oSit; but' like other pieces oiancient writing, (for you know birds have not Spoke for Some ages) it is liable to divers readings, at the pleaSure of different critics.
