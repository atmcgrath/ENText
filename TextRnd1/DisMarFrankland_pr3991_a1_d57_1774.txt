complaints are entirely occasioned f>y the confounded mode of modem female education. I cannot possibly afford to marry a woman who has been fashionably, 'that is extravagantly, li-centiousiy brought up from her infancy : .the naturally expensive taste of Such a woman is by no means to be gratified by me. With my moderate fortune 1 cannot pretend to make my addreffcs to a fine lady with a Small one; and where is the woman with a large one who will condeScend to give me her hand ? I do ■not, indeed, wish to meet with Such a ■condeftending woman: 1 detest all mercenary proceedings: I cannot bear the thoughts of taking a wife merely for the Sake of her money—No chains for me, Jack, though golden ones. Fetters are fetters, of whatever materials they are construtsted. Besides, when a woman
has
The Disinterested Marriage. 3
has made a man’s fortune, she is extremely apt to expedt too-many attentions from him—to Speak more plainly— to exerciSe a tyrannical power over him, especially if she finds him of a Submissive disposition. Unequal alliances, either national or matrimonial, are Seldom pro-dudbive of happy conSeqiiences. In every SuppoSable conn^dtion in life we cannot hope for felicity from it, unleSs we are pretty much upon a footing with' the perSons to whom we attach dur-felves. We are never eaSyl never comfortable, with people greatly Superior to - usS' 'from whatever Source that Superiority lariSes. Tou^ and most of the young fellows of the age, will, I know.

more inclined to fubScribe to them than you imagine you shall be. Young as I am mySelf, vigorous as my constitution is, and keen as all my appetites are ’ for joy, I Swear I could fit down with a woman, quite contented, provided that woman was not absolutely old, nor frightfully ugly. With a clean, good humoured, Sensible, fond wife, I could be as happy as if I was the delpotic master of a Seraglio of beauties.
With this turn of mind, this eafineSs of temper, is it not hard that I cannot meet with a woman to my taste ? — 1 will honestly confeSs, that a woman I muji hatte *. on a wife I cannot think of venturing.
‘‘ You may take a girl mto keeping.**

True; and that girl may be, most probably will be, ten times more proud.
Saucy, and extravagant than any wife— without bringing a shilling towards the Support of her current ex^ences.
“ You may be kejft yourfelf.”
WorSe and worst, a thcuSand times : Such chains are still more galling than thoSe of matrimony.

am too virtuous, indeed, .Deshorough, to commit adultery; but I do not start 'at a little simple fornication.
Thus, you fee, I have no very brilr liant hopes of what 7,call happineSs, as I am not possessed of an ample fortune ; that is, an income Sufficient to gratify my own wishes, and the desires alSo of my female companion. Without a female companion I have no idea of felicity : and I affure you, had I a large estate at my command, I would marry to-morrow, whether the girl of my choice had a Sixpence in her pocket or not: had I enough for us both, I should be extremely well Satisfied. The girl is ready—Were the fortune ready too—but as there is no profpeft of that., tell me no more of my happineSs. It is impossible

^ eoyeries which I am almost ashamed to communicate; but I cannot, I do ^ not desire to conceal them from you.
I adlually believe that I am in love —
- I have been horridly queer thefe last four and twenty hours—I cannot think what is the matter with me; but it is certainly So—You shall judge from the Symptoms which I am going to describe. In the first place, however, let, me give you a Iketch of the charming fellow who has made Such a monstrous bustle in my mind — yet I affure you that his conversation has done more execution than his perSon.
I was at Ranelagh last night with Sir Thomas LaScelles, and his Sister Mrs. Woodyer. , There never was Such a crowd: we could not get any Seats, but
were

were forced to walk round and round till we were ready to drop.
Growing weary, at length I complained So loud, that two gentlemen darting out of’ a box, one of them advanced to me, and made me an offer of it in So gallant a manner, that I was doubly obliged to him for it; and I really stood So long looking at him before I could find words to thank him, that I can give you a pretty exaft description of his perSon. He was tall, and finely formed; his air was that of a man of fashion; his complexion was clear, and animated with a glow of health, with a manly chearfulneSs not to be expressed. He had a pair of the most Seducing black eyes I ever beheld: his very fine hair was drest^with a carelelL neSs infinitely becoming; to conclude;

his elegant mouth, whenever he opened it, discovered the whitest and most even Set of teeth to be conceived. Such was the perfon of this charming fellow. With regard to his voice and his addreSs, I cannot possibly do them justice with my pen.
" Well—we accepted his offer—I should 'rather fay I accepted of it, as it was diredled only to me,'and took possession of the place he had quitted: my eager eyes, however, were brissdy employed in Search of him. Every now and then I Saw him, amidst the throng, talking to his < companion, on whoSe shoulder he leaned, with a vivacity perfedlly enchanting. I was So lost indeed in my Search after him, and in looking at him when I 'See him, that I hardly knew what I was
’about.	..	.
^	Hap«

Happening to miSs my handkerchief, I roSe in order to hunt for it, and found it under my feet. I picked it up immediately, and put it‘ into my pocket.
As Soon as I took it out at home, rumpled, a letter dropped out of it, signed Charles Frankland. It was addressed to a John Deshorough, ESq; in Clarges-street.
This letter contained Sentiments which delighted me exceedingly. It was full of Sensible and Spirited expreshons, and there Seemed to be a sincerity running through it, which made it doubly pleasing. It must certainly have been written, I think, by the agreeable fellow whom I had admired. I am by no means Sure, however, that it was written by him. There may have been twenty B 6	different
,12 The Disinterested Marriage.
different men in that box during the evening ; but as 1 know not the names of -any of them, as I know not even the charming fellow’s name who gave me his place, I am altogether in the dark about this adventure. I can only fay with any certainty, that the man whole air and figure So much attradted my at-.. tendon, looked just as if he could have written every word in the letter I So un-cxpedledly brought home with me. Undoubtedly he did write it—I cannot be mistaken. Now the conclufion I draw IfVom it is, that Such a Sweet fellow, cWith So excellent an understanding, and -So pleasing a perSon, muji necessarily make the woman whom he can love eompleatly happy : and, as I have a for-^tune Sufficient, I hope, to make him happy, if I can but keep it, as I am my own mistreSs, to confeSs the truth honestly,

Bell, I Sincerely wish mySelf that individual woman.
hfou will, probably, imagine that my head is quite turned, as I am So taken -with a man whom I had never Seen before, and to whom I have never Spoken : but though I was, I will own, greatly struck with his figure and manner of ad-dreSs, I am far more pleaSed with his letter, in which he has. Seemingly, o-pened his whole heart to his friend. What an honest, undesigning heart the agreeable wretch has ! He is indeed a very wretch, for he is already in love, yet cannot afford to marry. But he will never be any thing to me^ as he has declared he will never marry merely for money. I should not indeed chufe to be looked upon only as an appendage • to an estate: I must be loved as much

as I love., or I will never be a wife. To how great a degree I could love this wild fellow, I am almost afraid to alk myfelf. Wild he is as wind, but not wicked : now that just Suits me. After all, however, I cannot be certain that he wrote this letter, (which I have transcribed,^ and encloSed for your pe-rufal:) and were I Sure that he was the writer of it, how am I to get at him ? I may never See him again, but I will make it my buSineSs to alk every body I meet with about a Mr. Frank land and a Mr. Deshorough. By proceeding in Such a way I shall, perhaps, in time, know more of the matter than I do at preSent. As Soon as I have

LETTER III.
From the fame to the Same.
I WAS right. Bell: I thought I could not be mistaken: am I not exceedingly lucky to have got all my
information So Soon ? However, I shall not, I fancy, be the happier for it. I fuppofe now you want to hear how it happened in a hurry : I will make haste therefore to tell you.
The morning after I wrote to you I called on Harriot Swymmer, in conSe-
quence
i6 The Disinterested Marriage,
quence of an appointment between us a week ago. I was never leSs difpoSed to visit her, but I went. I found her brother with her. They were talking of Some company he had met with at Ranelagh the very night I was there.
“Lord blefs me!” exclaimed I, with a violent abruptnefs, “did you “ See a Mr. Frankland
“ Certainly I did,” replied he; “Charles “ Frankland is one of my most inti-“ mate friends; but he was not of “ your party. Lady Lucy, that night.”
“ No;” anfwered I, colouring excessively, “ we are not acquainted ; but “ I received an accidental civility from “ a gentleman of that name, I believe;
“I am
f
The Disinterested Marriage. 17
“ I am not Sure, however. What fort “ of a man is ,your Franklarid i*”
“ Tall, well-made and handSome, with a brown complexion,” Said he;
“ the honestest, best-natured fellow in “ the world.—Does this description v “ Square with yours ?” continued he. Smiling: “ but we shall Soon See, for I y exped him here every moment.”
How my heart fluttered. Bell! I was ready to die with apprehensions:
I longed to stay, and yet I was afraid lest I should be mistaken. However, I plucked up a little courage, and proceeded — “The man I mean, Mr.
“ Swymmer, is in love, I imagine.”
“ With your Ladyship ?” re plied he,,
Surveying me, archly.
'	“ Lord,
>
i8 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ Lord, no—I am quite a stranger “ to him,” Said I, blushing again, like an awkward creature as I was—“ but”—
“Oh,— yes,—” anSwered he, recol-lefting himSelf, and happily overlooking my embarrassment, “ I believe he is in “ love with a MiSs Price : yet I do not “ think they will come together; there “ is not money enough between them: “ Charles is too generous to distreSs the “ woman whom he pretends to love.”
Excellent! — thought I — This must be my man : there are few like him.
Before I could afk any more questions, or make any more ressedlions, the very man, the Sweet fellow, of whom we had been talking, came in.
With
The Disinterested Marriage. 19
W”ith a gracefulneSs not to be described, he advanced towards Harriot: then, turning to me, he fell back a little, as if recolleftion had made him think Something more than a formal bow recjuired of him, and threw a Smile into his animated countenance, which added a thouSand bewitching charms to features which were but too attradbive before. .
' >
I Smiled too, 1 believe: I certainly coloured, and looked like a fool, yet I was willing to fix him for an acquaintance at once, becauSe I did not know when 1 might See him again. I cur-tesied therefore, as if I thought my Self under obligations, and wished to make acknowledgments. I found mySelf strangely at a loSs—I was never more disconcerted in my life. At last, I Somehow contrived to mention Ranelagh;
and
to The Disinterested Marriagi^
and then, turning to him. Said, with all the good-humour I could call up in my face — “I believe. Sir, I was obliged to yeu for a feat Some nights ago : it was “ a most Seafonable relief, as I was ne-“ ver more weary in my life.*"
“ I am inexpressibly happy. Madam,*" replied he, with a charming voice, and a striking Satisfatstion in his looks, “ in ** having been of any Service to you.’*
This little Speech considerably increafed my prepossessions in his favour. In short. Bell, he absolutely enchanted me; and I believe I was So far taken in as not to be' able to diSguiSe the pleaSure 1 felt in being So near him ; though I do assure you I strove to conceal it. Whether Swym-mer Saw it I cannot tell, but he adted as
if
The .DismTERESTED Marriage. 21
if he had a mind to keep us together, by proposing a visit to Christie’s.
I made no objecStion tp his propoSal. I should have gone, I fancy, to the <end of the world with /ueh company.
Harriot immediately declared her approbation of her brother’s Scheme, and we let out, Frankland and I entered very freely into conversation. What a fine understanding he has! How ex-.quisite is his Sensibility ! how delicate is his taste ! In short. Bell, this is the man.—But he is in love with another woman—However, not being quite Sure that he had wrote the letter which I So much admired, I reSolved to have my curiosity gratified.
T aking

22 The Disinterested Marriage.
Taking it out of my pocket — “I “ fancy. Sir,” Said I, “ you are con-“ cerned in this letter. I am strongly ** inclined to believe indeed that you y wrote it.”-—putting it into his hand.
Take notice. Bell, I had Secured another copy. What an infinite deal of pains have I taken about this man already ! I wish he ever repays me: though, in my opinion, he well deferves all my Solicitude about him.
Taking the letter from me, he laughed, yet coloured a little, and looked rather confuSed. — “ Good God ! ” exclaimed he, “ how could that blundering fellow “ Deshorough drop my Scrawl ? — I am “ quite Sorry,” continued he, in a different tone, “ that your Ladyship had y the trouble of picking it up : it was
“ not
The Disinterested Marriaoe. 23
“ not in the least worthy of your atten-‘‘ tion’’—(thrusting it into his pocket.)
“ Indeed,*’ replied I, you do it not “ Sufficient justice : the letter is a very “ good letter : I will not pretend to Say “ that I have not read it, as it was open; and 1 am Sure it contains ex-cellent Sentiments.”
Your Ladyship does me unmersted “ honour,” Said he, with a reSpeftful bow, casting down, at the Same time, ' his bewitching eyes : but I am adlu-“ ally ashamed of your having Seen Such “ poor matters.”
“ If that is all,” cried Swymmer, laughing, “ pry thee write a better epistle, “ to make Lady Lucy amends for that “ which has fallen under her inipetstion.”
“ I
24 The Disinterested Marriage.
‘‘ I dare not take that liberty,” replied he, with a Scrutinizing look; to See, I thought, if he might or no.
“ You may, indeed,” anSwered L Smiling : “I shall not be at all Sorry to “ have Such a correlpondent.”
I was now afraid I had Said too much: I really wondered at mySelf, and blushed: yes, honestly blushed at my own aS-Surance.
He looked, and bowed again—Surely he will not write. If he writes I shall be lost. He is a divine creature. 1 could hardly, I own, prevail on mySelf to go while he staid. At last, however, fearful of being pronounced quite intoxicated with him, I roSe,
He

He followed me, and put me into my chair: and here, I fuppoSe, our acquaintance will end; for i cannot, decently, make any farther advances, and he did not Solicit another interview.
How heavy my heart is! How dull is my life! To make the affair worSe, a card is just arrived from. Lord Grashng-ton. I cannot possibly think of him^ after this insinuating, captivating Frailk-land.

WH AT'a-careleSs, idle, good-for-nothing rogue you are, to go and drop my letter at Ranelagh, and makfe me, by So doing, look like an aSs, before the most agreeable creature in the univerSe, who picked it up ; a Lady Lucy Menell ?
Lady Lucy was the very woman whom I took particular notice of that night: the very woman to whom, as she appeared to be quite tired with her cir- • t:ular walks, we resigned our box. Do you not recolledl her ? You cannot. Surely, have forgotten her. She was tall and elegant; not absolutely a beauty, but Something more : she had one of
thoSe

thofe faces which are full of expression and Sensibility : full either of a laughable vivacity, or an enchanting, irresistible languor. This is the woman who took up my letter, and who has made not a few Speeches to me about it: Speeches of a very intoxicating nature, I affure you : they have excited in me Some vain. Some Saucy SenSations. Indeed Jack, however, I wish you had not dropped this filly letter, for it has throwm me into the way of a woman whom I shall probably like better than I ought. I had but just, you know, been telling you in it, that I was miserable on account of the Sex; not ^ith a woman, but for want of one.

rashneSs. I will not, therefore, come in her fight. She looks Sweetly, I confeSs, and Speaks fairly too, at preSent; yet, should I perSevere in keeping up the acquaintance I have made with her, I should Soon expe6l to See a change in her. I cannot, indeed, expeCt her, with Such a Superiority in point of rank and fortune, to think in a favourable mannerof me. It will, consequently, be more prudent in me to think no more of her: for admitting any condescensions on her side in my favour, I shall, by availing mySelf of them, be fuppofed, and not unjustly, to adt under the influence of lucrative considerations. No—I am much too proud to be a petticoat pensioner. Once again. Jack, I wish you had not dropped my letter.

Lady Lucy to Lady Bell.
IT is as I Said. Frankland and I have never met since, though I have been warmly in purSuit of him from place to place. I just Saw him, flying, one morning into the Park^ and was really far gone enough to have stopped him : but though I Said “ Your lervant. Sir,” and looked as if I wished he would have Spoken to me, the inSenSible creature only took off his hat. Smiled, and hurried . away from me. To be fure he does not like me. Did he feel the Smallest desire to be acquainted, he would not, I imagine. Scamper away from me as if I was infedled with the plague.—Well! I cannot help it: I should, however, be C 3	ex-

extremely glad to fee, and be acquainted, with this MiSs Price ; and, now I think of it, I will call upon Harriot Swymmer; she, perhaps, can tell me every thing I want to know. When I come back I will finish my letter.
In Continuation.
I hurried to Swymmer, and all the way I went, fancied that she would not be at home; but I was mistaken. She was both at home, and alone. I was, however, at a loSs to begin my enquiry, being apprehensive of her fuS-pedting Something. I wanted to make a handSome introdudlion, but I could not bring it out cleverly. At last I laid a trap for the gratification of my curiofity, with a good round one.—You know what I mean. I was Sorry afterwards, indeed,
as

as it did me no fort of Service. “ Mr. “ Frankland,” Said I, “ is going to be “ married, I hear.”
“ Is he ?” replied Harriot, without taking her eyes from her tambour ; “ to “ whom?” “To a MiSs Price,” an-Swered I; “ though I do not know any ‘‘ thing about her.” “ Did you ever “ See her ? ” cried she, coolly—and then turned the conversation to a quite different fubjed.
Eager to reSume rtedn which I was So much interested mystlf, I thus proceeded—“ I want to See this MiSs Price ; y I wonder whether she is pretty.”
“ I know nothing about her,” Said ' Harriot, with rather a fretful tone, as if she was tired of hearing of her.

“ I am Sure Somebody mentioned her “ in this houSe,” replied I.
“ My brother, 1 SuppoSe—He knows “ her.”
“ Where is your brother

** Pshaw!” anSwered I, peevishly—-I was adlually in a pet.
Just when I was thinking of taking leave, who should come in but Frank-land himSelf ?
“ Is Mr. Swymmer at home, Ma-“ dami ?” Said hetoHarriot. Then, bowing to me^ he added, ‘‘ Your Ladyship’s “ most obedient.”

My heart began to thump strangely: at first I thought to look cool, in order to shew that I refented his indifference but should I not, by Such a behaviour, have shewn him alSo that I was hurt by it ?—I atsted in another manner : with a Smile I told him, that I was come to enquire after a Lady of his acc^uaintance, a MiSs Price.
“ She is a most agreeable girl,” Said he, with a frankneSs that charmed me. “ Your Ladyship would, I believe, be “ pleaSed with her.”
“ Very probably,” replied I: “ pray “ tell me, Mr. Frankland, what Sort of “ a perSon has she ?”
“ She is tall and fiender, yet genteelly “ made,” anSwered he:	she is fair;
C 5	_ “she

she has pretty little features, and the “ roSy blushes in her cheeks animate her whole appearance.”
What a' Sweet description. Bell! I was half in love with the girl, mySelf, or rather with the piflure he had drawn of her.
“ Vastly agreeable, indeed,” Said I: and stow is her mind—if you, as a “ man, pay any regard to that ?
“ I certainly do, Madatn—A woman “ without a mind is, in my opinion, ex-“ tremelydefedlive, brilliant as her perSo-nal attradtions may be—PattyPrice has “ a very good improved understanding; “ and a gentle, affectionate disposition, “ She is as mild as the western breeze:

“ A faultleSs charadler, I fuppoSe ! ” cried I, interrupting him, out of patience to hear him So extravagant in her praiSe, though I hated mySelf, at the fame time, for being So ridiculous — and Sat down discontented, without fpeaking another word.
During my silence Frankland chatted with Harriot, and took not any notice of me till Swymmer appeared, who told us that every body was going to the Fan-toccini, and ashed us if we would be of the party—looking at Frankland and me—“ What party ?” Said Harriot.

ed he — “ will you join us ?—and “ Frankland,” continued he, “ will “ make one, I hope.”
I consented immediately: there was nothing I liked better; but my gentleman began to shy off, by faying that he believed he had an engagement that evening.
I w^as almost mad at the thoughts of Josing So fine an opportunity. “ Nay “ now,” Said I to him, with a freedom on which I have Since refletsted with Some wonder, “ you shall not Serve us So”—-Then, calling Harriot to my assistance, I added—“ Let us make him go with us, “ MiSs Swymmer.”
“ Ay,” replied she, with the Same provoking non-(halance which she had

With a look which would have charmed infenjibility. herSelf, he replied, “ I am “ all obedience to will. Madam ; I “ am quite at your diSpoSal.”
“ I take you at your word,” anSwer-cd I, laughing, “ and shall put mySelf “ under your protedion, for the even-« ing.”

Mr. Erankland to Mr. Desborough.
I Am drawn into a pretty Scrape, by your having dropped that letter: for I will Say that my letter to you, picked up at Ranelagh, was the foundation of my acquaintance with this enchanting' woman, who has a<5lually afforded me So much pleafure, that she has prevented me from being pleaSed with any other woman.
I met Lady Lucy again at Swym-mer’s. We have made a downright friendship with each other; but our attachment—there is a malicious devil in the way—can never come to any thing more.
She
\
44 The DijinterestedMarriagt.
She has hurt her ancle ; I go and fit with her every day, for two or three hours together: we chat, laugh, play and sing: by the by, she sings like an angel.—When I called the Second day of her confinement, I Saw an organ in the room; there was a guittar too. Some music-books lay upon the table, and I desired her not to let the instruments remain unemployed.
“ It is imposhble for me to walk to the organ without help,” Said she; “ but, “ now I think of it, do you sit down to “ the organ, and I will take, up the “ guittar.”
“ How do you know that I can play Said I.

“ Have they only told you that I am “ mufical ? have they communicated “ no intelligence more interesting ?” thought I, looking earnestly at her, while I began to touch the keys.
“ Oh! that is quite ravishing,” cried she i “ do, play it again.”
“ And So you are, to madneSs”-— thought I—but take notice, Deshorough,
I Spoke not a word the truth is, I -ought not to indulge the Smallest idea concerning this fine lively creature.
Yester-
45 The Disinterested Marriage.
Yesterday I questioned Swymmer very clofely about her.—Her father, the late
Earl of----, upon losing a large Sum to
Lord Grassington at play., and upon his forgiving the debt, which he was unable to discharge, offered him the refuSal of his daughter: his Lordship, however, whofe father was then alive, and at his estate in Ireland, being Sent for by him, as he was Seized with a dangerous disorder, and wished earnestly to See him before he died. Set out direflly, without Seeing Lady Lucy, who was at that time with an aunt of hers in Yorkshire. The Earl dying Soon after Lord Graf-Sington, left his preSent Lordship at liberty to marry his daughter. If Jhe re-fuSes to fulfil her father’s promiSe, in cafe of its being claimed, she is to forfeit a great part of her fortune. From that time to this. Lord Grassington has
been
i
The Disinterested Marriage. 47*
been detained in Ireland by buSineSs, and by a Severe fit of illneSs : he is just recovered, and has wrote to the Lady in the charadter of a claimant. Her an-fwer to his letter was a very doubtful one. She hourly expedts to hear of the death of the only Son of her father’s brother, who has been, for Some time, in a decline, and is now at Montpellier by ’ the advice of his physicians.—In this situation are her affairs at preSent; and if you think I shall not Sufficiently embar-raSs mySelf by a tender attachment to Such a woman, you must be very ignorant indeed. I can only add, that I have all the reaSon in the world to believe she likes me, but she likes me, perhaps, only for my company, pcur tuer le terns. Admitting, however, I dare flatter mySelf that her prepossessions ' in my favour should increaSe; admitting
she
48 The Disinterested Marriage.
she should have a Serious inclination for me, can I SuppoSe that she will ever carry her partiality So far, as to give up her fortune for me ? Besides, circumstanced as she is, I cannot prefume to addreSs her; I cannot, with the least propriety, tell her that I love her, when I know that she is partly engaged to Lord Grashngton. If this cousin, indeed, dies, she will be mistrefs of afi independent fortune; but then if I make my addreffes to her after Us death, I shall appear to have waited for it. I cannot bear to be thought So mercenary a devil, especially by Such a woman as this is, Deshorough : no, I had better take my leave of her at once : but there is Something So faScinating in every thing she fays and does, that I look upon a Separation from her, almost like the Separation of my Soul from my body.—She is

perpetually inviting me too, and attaches me to her by every enchanting art in her power; she never considers, all the time, that while she is amusing herSelf, she is tormenting me ; for I can by no means imagine, as much as she Seems to be pleaSed with my Society, that my absence would really make her uneaSy. I think I will stay away, and try. Her ancle is almost well; my attendance on her, therefore, appears to be no longer necessary at preSent; yet how, in the name of heaven, shall I fill up the diSmal void in my Soul, when I am deprived of her conversation !

Bell ? However, it is not come to that yet; though I could Scarce keep mySelf from reproaching him, for having staid away So many days.
He began his apology in the following words : — “ After having deprived my-

Just at that moment Thomas opened the,door, and Lord Grassington came in.

Frankland Sat down, and discovered nothing of a lover-like appearance; my nord, however, eyed him, I thought, in a particular manner; and he., I imagine, observed his Scrutinizing looks; for he presently roSe, and, with an eaSy air, wished me a good morning.

to a woman with whom he is not more acquainted than I am with Lord GraS-sington, and, perhaps, likes her no better; yet I do not See how he can get off, as she was left by her father to the care of his,^ who Solemnly promiSed that his Son should marry her, though it is highly probable that your Ladyship is the 6bje'(5l of his choice :, but as he has never mentioned his prepossessions in your favour to you, I think it absolutely necessary to acquaint you with them. I take this opportunity, therefore, to let you know what you are to exped; that is, no Small opposition from MiSs Plastow, as the diSputed lover happens to be very agreeable.
Now for a few words about my own affairs,
I am
The Disinterested Marriage. 75
I am determined, since Lord Grassing-ton will persist in following me, to talk very freely to him upon the Subjedl in question, and to tell him, that as it is impossible for me to love him, it will be much happier for	as well as
' for me., to give over all thoughts of me: I shall inform him that it will be both cruel and unjust to deprive me of more of my fortune than will anSwer the Sum which my father lost to the late Lord Grassington ; I shall alfo inform him, that I am ready to make a handfome addition to it, in consideration for his compromising the affair. If this mode of proceeding proves unSatisfadtory to him, I am reSolved to forfeit the whole, rather than marry a man who can take So ungenerous an advantage of my father’s will. In this manner I intend to obtain my freedom; and when I have got it, I E 2	shall
^5 The .DISINTERESTED Marriage^’
fiiall think it incumbent on me to make much of it : for, should I loSe my liberty a Second time, 1 shall loSe it for ever. Besides, though Frankland has ’ the most love-like looks and behaviour I ever obServed in any man, he Seems to be as little inclined to a Serious engagement with me, as I am for entering into a connexion for Lord Grassing-ton. He laughs, and chats, and sings and plays with me; but I am not, therefore, to play the fool for life. We may like each other extremely well for a few hours, but should be, perhaps, horridly mortified, were we tied together for ever and aye.—It is plain, however,	j
by the letter, which contained the real	»
Sentiments of his heart, and which must have been written with unquestionable sincerity, as it was designed only for the inSpedion of a particular friend, that	^

he purpoSed to marry when he could meet with a woman Suitable to him: and I cannot help thinking but that he fancies me to be Such a woman in point of fortune ; as iiry fortune, were it quite at my own difpoSal, must be a larger one than a man, with only five hundred a year, can reaSonably expeD. This very fortune therefore, my dear, may be the greatest charm, for aught I know, in his eyes. Were I Sure that he is ac-. mated by mercenary motives, I would never See.him, never listen to him again; He shall be informed of the true state of my affairs ; and if, when I appear to have little or nothing, he prefers me to all other women, I may, I think, conclude, that he is as worthy, as disinterested a fellow, as ever lived : but then, should I take advantage of Such uncommon generosity of Sentiment ?

She was alone; she was undressed, and blushed excessively at my entrance; and her blushing made me apprehensive that I had, in conSequence of my delirious joy, committed Some blunder: but she gave me relief in a moment, by Saying, “ Where have you been this te-

Lord Grassington Surveyed us both with looks which boded us no good ; and thoSe which he darted at me'vtcvQ particularly malignant; but as Lady Lucy had fent for met I thought I had no busineSs to stir, and that my retreat would denote a pusillanimity.

And was not that declaration enough to make me stay—ay, and to hope too ? — How my heart bounds at the delightful idea ! And yet, to what purpoSe do I indulge it, if I cannot prudently make an offer to a woman of her quality with my little income: if it is too Small for a wife in a private way,

I am not Sure, indeed,- that this dear creature would re-SuSe compliance v/ith my wishes. I fometimes fancy that. I am totally an object of indifference in her eyes. If she really loves me—what a transporting thought!—will she not conform to my desires ?

Lady Lucy to Lady Bell,
WELL, my dear; I told Frank-land how diSagreeably I am circumstanced. He made no anSwer to the diScloSure of my Situation : he could not indeed get an opportunity to return a reply; for the odious man came in, and prevented every thing. Frankland alSo, by staying, prevented me from carrying the design I had formed into execution.; and yet, as I had Sent for him, I could not expe(5t his Speedy de- i parture.	"	;

You are SurpriSed, I imagine, at my ! having Sent for Frankland—I am Surprised, indeed, mySelf: the truth is, he j

had not been near me for Several days, and I became So restleSs, So uneaSy, that I could not help diSpatching a meS-Sage to him. He came, and Said a thousand civil things, more civil than he had yet uttered; which drew Some from me in return. In short, we Seemed to be mutually pleaSed with each other. While we were in the midst of a very interesting tete-d.t&te. Lord Grashngton broke in upon us, and Spoilt ail. I confeSs I was disappointed.
In Continuation.	^
I have had Such an inundation of company since I laid down my pen, that I have not been able to find a Single moment to finish my letter—And of what can I now write about, except my situation with Frankland ?
I Seized
92 The Disinterested Marriages
I Seized the first opportunity in my power to inform Lord Grassington, that as I could never love him, I positively never would marry him. In short, 1 Said every thing I had intended to Say to him, but I might as w'ell have talked to the floor : I was as far as ever from the point I had in view; for he told me that he never would give me up, and that the wealth of worlds could not make him the (lightest reparation for the loSs of me : —concluding with an affurance, that he would w^ait my time, with all the patience he was master of.
I was horridly provoked at this anSwer, | and replied, — “ Rather than marry yFUy i “ my Lord, with whom I have no | “ profpedt of being happy, I will for-“ feit every penny of my fortune.-—
“ You may aft therefore as you pleaSe— y you may take it, or relinquish it, just

The Disinterested Marriage. 93
“ as your inclination determines your “ decisiom”
Finding that I was in earnest, he endeavoured to Sooth me into a good humour with him, and to wind me to hi« purpoSe; but I was inflexible; and acquainted him with my reSolution not to Say any more upon the fubjed:.; adding, that as I had not made that reSolution in a hurry, nothing should induce me to change it. Perceiving thereSore that he could neither make me talk upon that Subjed, nor upon any other, he left the room, quite out of temper. He went away extremely dissatisfied, and I remained still more So ; for I could not well Send for Frankland just at that time: I should shave appeared, by So doing, deSirous of his making me an offer, when 1 had been rejeded by every

body. I shallj certainly loSe all my lovers, upon this reverSe of fortune; but I am determined not to marry the man whom I do not love. I need not, indeed, put mySelf into a fright, I believe; taking it for granted, that no man will think of marrying me. Lord Grassington excepted. However, tho*
I did not know how, in this humiliating state, to See Frankland, I wished to receive a visit from him.
He came at last—I was Serious and disconcerted; yet I afked him where he had been during So long an abSence.
He replied, that he had been in a very \ ' joyleSs condition from the time he had left me — “If I could have found joy,” continued he, “ in any other place, I “ should not have troubled you with “ my company here again.”

“ I am obliged to you,” replied I, Smiling ; I find you came only for your “ own pleafure, and not for mine.”
“ Indeed you wrong me,*’ anSwered he: “ it is not in my power to contribute “ to your pleafure: and as mine consists “ chiefly in Seeing you, and hearing you, “ it is very natural for me to come “ after it.”
I felt my face glow while he talked in this manner, as he had fixed his eyes upon me; I, therefore, was obliged to throw mine down ; the necessity of Such a proceeding made me Sigh, though very Softly.
“ You are not happy. Lady Lucy,” Said he; “ Something hangs upon your “ mind to-day : will you not trust me

“ with it The communication of “ your Sentiments may, poshbly, relieve “ your mind.”
“ Nothing will relieve my mind,” anSwered I, “ but my Lord Grassing-“ ton’s relinquishing his claim both to “ me and my fortune,; and that event,
” I fear, is not to be expe<5led.”
“ There may be other ways found “ out, I imagine,” Said he, “ to restore “ your mind to its former tranquility—
“ Had I an estate worth your Lady-“ ship’s acceptance, I should not heSi-“ tate a moment to lay it at your feet:
“ and. Small as mine is, if you will “ condeScend to receive it, it is yours.”
I was nc. a little furpriSed at this offer, and at the abruptneSs of it. I could

not tell how to think it was a Serious one, though it was delivered in a manner Sufficient to make me think him quite in earnest. Not having it in my power to be in earnest mySelf, I knew not what better to shy, than to tell him that he was in a very merry humour, or he would not have been able- to rally in Such a manner, upon the most Serious of ft’-l Subjeds.
He replied, in ariSwer, that he was extremely Serious, and called upon heaven, in the most Solemn language, to witneSs the truth of what he had uttered ; adding,That he had been charmed with me from my very first acquaintance ; that nothing but an inequality of fortune had prevented his addressing me with all the energy with which his Soul was filled every time he Saw me; and

that, as we were how brought nearer to a level with each other (confessing, however, there was still great preSumption in the attempt) he had dared to offer himSelf, and all he could call his, to my acceptance.
I heard him out, but was incapable of making any reply : I stood quite em-barraffed, without venturing to look up, much leSs to Speak to him.
While I was in this embarraffed state, he Seized my hand, and pressing it to his lips. Said, “ Can you pardon me, I “ Lady Lucy, for Such an incoherent ^ “ addreSs ? Where our hearts are Sen-“ Sibly affefled, it is not in our power “ to communicate our feelings in the

How modest ! What a pretty apd*-logy !

“ Why then,” replied he, “ it will “ be worth just nothing at all: but “ you will not, cannot refuSe me; you “ mufi permit me, by the whole Services “ of my life, to endeavour, at least, to “ contribute to the happineSs of yours^

larger, entirely for her fake; for the SmallneSs prevents her from accepting of it. She loves me indeed too well to accept of it. This declaration may perhaps, at first sight, have the air of a paradox, but it is nevertheless a true one. I would not have made my offer, had I not been certain that her fortune was on the point of being diminished; and Jhe would not have rejedled it, had flie been Sure that there were no prefent hopes of its being increaSed: ye: she frankly confessed that it was in my power alone to make her happy, though she would not hear any more upon the fub-jedl at that time: she stridUy forbade me, indeed, to revive it in a future conversation. I acquieSced at the moment, but I shall endeavour to Seize the first opportunity to perSuade her to conSent to making our-

Selves mutually happy, by the cloSest of all human connetfUons.
When I went home, after my last interview with Lady Lucy, I found a card from Sir William and Lady MiSe-nor, to request me to be of their party
to VauxhalL	'
Having no engagement upon my hands, I attended them. The elegant Mrs. Lauder was with them: she is just returned from Ireland, her year of mourning being expired. She is reckoned a first-rate beauty, and is, really, very handSome; yet there is a delicacy, a taste about her, still more attractive than her perSonal charms. She is young, and, does not want Senle ; she has only a little kind of hauteur in her look, voice and manner, which hinders her from
being

being So agreeable as she would otherwise be. She did me the honour, hoW’ ever, to treat me with particular attention, and even condeScended to take more notice of me than of any of the numerous train of men who followed her, admiring,, or pretending to admire	'
her. Had my heart been quite at liberty, I might have been coxcomb enough to imagine she had taken a fancy to me ; but it is too much attached to Lady Lucy, to be‘deeply affedSed by any other objedt. I was, however, very affiduous, I could not help being assiduous about Mrs. Lauder, while she was of the party.

She Smiled, but faintly,.! thought, and shook her head. Soon afterwards the bright, the blooming widow, as if impatient for my return, failed cloSely by us, and cast at me a most Significant ' look r a look which drew a sigh from my Lucy, who viewed us both with a Scrutinizing attention : — Go,” Said she, pushing me gently; “ you are “ wanted.”

I had no opportunity of Saying much, as the crowd was continually increasing; but to prevent her being incommoded, I put my arm round her, by way of defence.

Turning her Sweet eyes towards nie, with a delicious languor in them, she Said, ■— “ Are you not gone- yet

She Seemed pleaSed with my unwil- -lingnefs to leave her; she almost leant againSt me, while I Supported her with rapture. There was a Sort of corre- / fpondence between us two, with which every body about us was totally unacquainted.
While ! was enjoying more real de-' light than I had ever experienced before, a message came from Sir William, Lady MiSenor, and Mrs. Lauder, to desire me to return to them.
This

This message roufed me from my dream of happineSs.
“ You tnnjl go to them fiGWV Said Lady Lucy, looking reluffance.
Only for to-night,” — replied I, pressing her hand; in the morning I ■“ will sty to you again.
A thouSand tender things were discernible in her countenance—1 then left her, but not without the utmost regret, to Lord Graffmgton,
When I returned to my company, they all rallied me, and chid me pretty Smartly, for having deSerted them, and insisted upon my confining mySelf to them for the rest of the evening; during which the fair widow played all

She laughed, she languished, she discovered every charm she was possessed of to the greatest advantage; she^ Sung too, at last, at the request of Lady MiSenor, and, in a very fine style, I could not but do ample justice to her melodious tones, and to her judicious management of them : you know I am fond of music almost to extravagance—-Here she triumphed : she thought she had, at length, gained a conquest over me.
When she was in the midst of her exultation, however, I recolle«5ted the elegant strains which I had heard from Lady Lucy’s lips, and that recolledion brought her strongly before fancfs arrayed in all her dazzling beauties.
No longer were my looks direded to the fcducing Lauder; they wandered in I

Search of the Sole mistreSs of my affec-. tions: but Jhe.^ I believe, quitted the place Some time before our party thought of returning home.
When we Separated, Mrs. Lauder insisted upon my vifiting her.
I bowed, but made no promiSe which I did not intend to perform.
The next morning I hurried to Lady Lucy: she was not up: she was not very well, her woman told me.
I went home disappointed, and chagrined—By the anxiety I felt at her indisposition, I felt how much I loved her.

Thinking she would rife before dinner, if she was not very ill, I went again to her houSe. She was not yet ready to See company.
When I returned home I found a card from Sit William Mifenor, desiring my company to dinner. My disturbed •mind was not Sufficiently compoSed to enable me to mix with any body.—I wished to be alone, and, therefore, dispatched an apology.
A Sealed note was now brought to me from Sir William. In that he So I earnestly pressed me to an interview with him, if only for a quarter of an hour, that I repaired .to him immediately, as T would not be. hindered from calling at Lady Lucy’s in the eversing.
When

When I came to Sir William, he told me my perSon and behaviour had made So great an impression upon Mrs. Lauder, that he was Sure I might have her for ashing — “ She is handSome, you fee, ‘‘ and young: she is not ill-tempered, “ and has a clear two thouSand a year “ jointure, with twenty thouSand pounds “ in her pocket.”
“ Had she millions, I could not think “ of marrying a woman whom I did “ not love,” replied I.
“ Not love Such a woman as Mrs.
Lauder! ” Said he, hastily : “ Surely “ you must be very nice indeed. — A ‘‘ woman whcSe perSon is as faultLSs as “ her condudl is irreproachable.—I wish, “ Frankland, I was of your age, and “ in your place, for her Sake.”

“ I wish you was, Sir William,” Said I; “ though I do not by Saying So pay “ a great-compliment to the Lady.”
“ Pshaw! prythee Charles,” anSwered he, “ come and dine with us: I will “ lay any Sum that in a few hours the “^widow’s conquest over you is com-“ plete, and that you will thank me “ for having brought you acquainted “ i With sher."*"
I told him in reply, that I should,always think mySelf obliged to him for his friendly intention, though it was not in my power to avail my Self of it; adding, that I was absolutely engaged, and on no account could meet Mrs. Lauder.
“ Why
I

“ Why then,” Said he, “you may
“ meet her another time — I shall not “ inform her, you may be Sure, that “ you do not- admire her So much as “ she wishes to make you, as I hope “ for a happy change in your fenti-“ ments concerning hei*'—You will like-“ her better when you know more ofi “ her.”
Not chuSing to anSwer his' civility with rudeneSs,, I only replied' with a Smile, and left; him, to maJc-e my third appearance at Lady Lucy’s, between six and leven.—Again I was refuSed admittance.—I did not now know what to think of my repeated diSmissions. I -knew not whether Lady Lucy was really ill, or only pretended to be So, to avoid Seeing me. I determined, however,., to go till I was let in.

126 The Disinterested Marriage,
While I was fitting abSorbed in thought, and striving to account for a behaviour So new to me, Swymmer came in, rallied me upon my being quite out of Spirits, and dragged me by force to Marybone.
There, most unluckily, was Mrs. Lauder, and a large party.—Seeing me, as Soon as I entered the gardens, she Seized me in a short time afterwards, and it was impossible for me, without being guilty of downright riideneSs, to get away. She even threw herSelf entirely under my protedion, and obliged me to wait on her home. — When I was there, she would have forced me to stay and Sup with her; but I broke /rom her, and retired to my own apartment.

An D So, becauSe I was not Sufficiently foolish before, I must be jealous; yes—jealous, to a degree, of this Frankland : that is, I am vexed to See other people like him as well as I do. How weak, how inconsistent! I Saw him So much taken notice of by a Mrs. Lauder, a young handfome widow, with a large fortune, that I found I could not bear it; and So I went, and shut my Self up at home; shut my Self up from the only perSon whom I wished to See : yet, with what propriety can I be continually receiving him who, of all men, I ought to avoid, as our interviews, increasingly-pleasing to each o-ther, must increaSe our mutual inclination,

Besides, I now feel mySelf So much affected by his connection with this Mrs. Lauder, that I am very much afraid of his discovering the anxiety I cannot help enduring on his acquaintance with a woman whoSe fortune would be exceedingly convenient to him : and as she is alSo young and handSome, I think he can make no reafonable objection to her, if she should be diSpoSed to purchaSe So fine a fellow with her money.—My Spirits sink at the thoughts of Such an alliance; and yet, if it will make hArrk / happy, shall I be So mean. So Selfish, as to endeavour, to prevent it ?

In Continuation,
I have just this morning received yours. I admire your resolution; it will be quite as efficacious, I fancy, as Lord Ashbourne’s visit to MiSs Plastow.

Mr. Frankland to Mr. Desborough.
OH ! Jack!—Had I but a million to deferve this charming, this uncommon woman ! Surely she is a very extraordinary charader. She has a Soul Superior to her Sex. No man in the world can be worthy of her. It was not poshble for me, during Several days, to gain admittance ; though I called on her continually, she was never to be Seen. At last, however, she went abroad ; and I learnt, by dint of bribery, from her w(F man^ whither she was gone.—She was gone to people with whom I had no acquaintance : I, therefore, could not decently introduce mySelf; but I Sauntered in the street till her coach came for her. With a few more golden arguments, I
prevailed
134 The Disinterested Marriage.
prevailed on her fellows to let me feat mylelf in a corner of it, and wait her arrival. The flambeaus Soon discovered me.—“ Good God ! here’s a man in the “ coach I” Said she.— “ BleSs me, Mr. “ Frankland, how could you fright me So ? pray come out.”
Indeed I cannot,” replied I, earnestly : “I have called above a dozen “ times at your door, on purpoSe to “ Speak to you, and could never meet “ with you. Since, then, I have been “ So lucky at last, I beg I may be per-,	“ mitted to make uSe of the preSent fa-
“ vourable opportunity.”
She looked embarraffed. Sweetly disconcerted, as if she did not know what to Say.
« Well
The Disinterested Marriage. 135
“ Well then,” cried she, at last, “ since it must be So—John, go home.”
During our ride I acquaintedsher with all the anxiety and concern I had endured from the time of her denying her-Self to me; having been apprehenfive that she might be exceedingly indiS-pofed.
“ I was not at all indilpoSed,” replied she, with hurried accents ; “ not at all, “ Sir: I have been very well.”
“ Why then, my dear Lady Lucy,” Said I, taking her hand, would you “ refuSe to See me ? What have I done “ to deServe Such cruel treatment
“ Nothing at all,” anfwered she; “I “ have no fault to find with you.”
“ For
136 The Disinterested Marriage.
For heaven’s Sake then do not, by “ refusing me the happineSs of your “ company, drive me to deSpair.”
“ You must not talk to me in this “ manner, Mr. Frankland,” Said she:
“ we must no longer carry on an inti-“ macy which can only create mutual “ uneaSinefs. You must attach yourSelf “ entirely to Mrs. Lauder, who is a ■ “ very sine woman, and very capable “ of making the man she loves, happy.”
“ I do not understand you,” replied I; wondering not a little at her having heard of the favourable opinion entertained of me by /^ncLady.
“ You will not understand me: but “ you muft know that when you are
under an engagement to one woman,
y you,

The Disinterested Marriage. 137 “ yon, certainly, ought not ta follow “ another.”
“ You really perplex me exceedingly, “ Lady Lucy,” anSwered I: “ to no wo-“ man in the world, but to yourSelf, have “ I any attachment; nor can I imagine “ how you came to think of Mrs. “ Lauder.”
“ Mrs. Lauder,” Said she, “ perfedSy “ Sensible of your merit, is alSo ex-“ tremely well qualified to make you “ happy: you will be mad, therefore, “ to negleft So fair an opportunity: “ you will be cruel to her^ and un-“ kind to yourfelfS^

certainly be very unkinti to myfelf^ “ and very cruel to herP
“ But why should you not like Mrs. “ Lauder ? ” replied she, with great quickneSs; “ she is young, handSorae, y and fond of you.”
“ Were she dying for me,” Said I, with as much quickneSs, “ I would not “ marry her'—I cannot marry her : my ‘‘ whole heart—my Soul is yours.”
“ Ah, Frankland ! — talk no more
in this strain; we were never designed “ for each other. You must not think “ of me: I have nothing in my power “ to give you : Mrs. Lauder has an “ ample fortune, with an .enlarged “ mind.”.
‘‘ Were

“ Were she a thouSand times hand-“ fomer than she is; were it possible “ for her to be more generous, I could “ not love her. — Let us therefore, I “ intreat you, talk no more about “ her.”
“ But indeed we will. — I shall talk “ of nothing elfe while we arc to-“ gether.’*
“ You could not have chofen a more
disagreeable fubjedl,” Said I; rather piqued at a behaviour which I thought most provokingly ill timed.
“ I will be silent then,” replied she— and Spoke not another word.
When the coach stopped, she bade , jne a good night.
“ Not
I
T40 The DSsinteres'ted Marriage.
“ Not yet,’* my dear Lady Lucy,”
Said I— “ I shall not leave you quite So “ Soon.” Accordingly, 1 followed her into the houSe.
She Sat down rather with a dejedSed^ than a melancholy aSpeft. Taking a Seat near her, I strove, by every art I was master of, to engage her in a conversation on the Subjedt I most wished to enter upon ; but she remained a long time wsthout Speaking.-—At last she' began to advance So many arguments tri favour of my marriage with Mrs; Lauder, that I grew quite out of hur mour, and freely told her that I was entirely nsistaken in her; that I had once flattered mySelf with being looked upon by her with Some degree of ten-derneSs ; adding, that as I‘ found h was deceived in the only woman whom I
could
i
The Disinterested Marriage. 141
could love, I should give up all thoughts of the Sex>for the future.
“ How Simple that is now!” cried she, .with a plaintive kind of tone, which was infinitely touching —
“ How can you rejedt a woman who is “ adlually dying for you, and who can “ make your fortune ”
“ How can you rejedl a man,” replied I, “ who is really miSerable in “ ^conSequence of your refuSal ^ ”
“ BecauSe I cannot make his for-
tune,” anSw^ered she; and the tears Started from her eyes while she Spoke—
By thoSe tears, and by Suddenly turning , her face from me to conceal them, she convinced me that I was still very dear to her: yet all the eloquence with
which
142 The Disinterested Marriage^
which love inSpired me — and Surely thoSe who are under the influence of that passion have more elocution than they are masters of upon common occasions, was not prevailing. She would not be moved by it. I was therefore obliged to leave the fubjetl, as she not not only requested me to Say no more upon it, but insisted upon my giving it up.
Lady Lucy’s uncommon behaviour has affedted me So much, that I honestly declare I wish I had been brought up in Some way to improve my estate, that I might be able to make her a more considerable offer; an offer more worthy of her acceptance. — But it is too late now—I am unfit for every thing.

Full of refiedlions last night, arising from my very diSagreeable Situation, I began to reproach mySelf for having given a looSe to unreasonable repinings, as if happineSs w'as no where to be met with but in affiuent circumstances, and in exalted stations. Is it rational to Sup-poSe that none except the rich can be shappy ? How abSurd ! how unjust are Such ideas! How few, how very few would taste felicity, were it confined to any particular situation ! — No—happineSs is pretty equally diffuSed over the whole world ; and the lowest often enjoy it, while the rich sigh for it in vain.— The different notions entertained about pleaSure, reSult chiefly from the different educations and purSuits of mankind.

From the fame to the Same^
AS I was determined to leave London, I began to prepare every thing for that purpoSe : and as I am re-Sol ved never to marry Lord Grassing-ton, I had given my Servants orders not to let him in : however, bn his earnestly-requesting to See me, I was weak e- • nough to hope that he relented, and that he was willing to releaSe me from all my engagements. I therefore admitted him.
He only Spent his time in making uSe of a thouSand arguments, to prevail on me to agree to what he wanted ; to make me believe that it was my father’s H 3	earnest

earnest desire, as well as his own, that I should marry him.
I would not be drawn in by the flim-zineSs of his reaSoning. I told him plainly, that if my father had been acquainted with my great aversion to him, " he never would have been So unkind as to leave me in So diSagreeable a situation : — adding, that since his will could not be revoked, I had nothing to do but to pay him the Sum demanded ; the payment of which would give me a right to insist upon his not troubling me any more with his company.
And can you be So cruel,” Said he,
“ as to wish to inflift Such a punish-ment upon me, only for admiring “ you; only for preferring you to all your Sex ? ”
« It

“ It is infinitely more cruel in you.,
“ my Lord,” anSwered I, “ to prevent “ me from marrying the man I like, by accepting of the greatest part of “ my fortune; to which you can have no other right than that which you “ derive from my father’s too partial “ will in your favour.”
I love you too sincerely to See you in “ the arms of another, and therefore claim my right, Madam, to So large a part of “ your fortune — That part, were you “ mine, should be in your own power, with “ a considerable addition to it from me;
“ and I would do every thing I could “ think of to render your Situation agreeable to you. Were I' to- giv^e ; “ you up, you Would, I know, imme-“ diately give your hand to Frank-“ land, and See me no more. It is very H 4	“ natural

In anSwer to this Speech I told him, that as I did not wish to receive favours from any body which I could not repay, I had rather Settle every thing, and break off all eonnedions with him.
He replied, that I aded with great Severity, not to give him time to take every step in his power to gain my af-fedions.
I anSwered,

He bowed coolly, and left the room.
As Soon as he retired I Sat down, and, with a flood of tears, lamented the necessity I was under of affedling an indifference which I was far from feeling. At the very mordent I drove him from me, I could have told him that I paf-fionately loved him. I even longed most earnestly to let him know how much he was beloved by me: to let him know that he, and he alone, was in poffeflion of my heart. It was the af-fedion however I felt for him, which prevented me from making a diScovery of my fenSations to his ruin.

Mr. Frankland to Mr. Desborouch.
TH E dear, amiable creature is gone: she has left both me and the town. Nobody knows when she will return. She has most stridUy forbidden me to attempt Seeing her, or writing to her. She would not even Suffer me to take leave of her. I was extremely disconcerted by that part of her behaviour'*; So much, indeed, that I believe I discovered an indifference which I did not
feel

' feel; an indifference of which I heartily repented the moment I was out ^of her fight: for Some time after I returned home, I was in a state of the utmost uncertainty, not knowing whether 1 should not go back to her, and insist upon taking a more tender adieu.—I fludtuated So long, piqued at her coolneSs, that when I returned, the coach had just drove from the door. When I thought she was come home, I went again. The Servant told me that she was retired for the night, and had given orders to be denied to every body.—The next morning, at six o’clock, she Set out for Sel-by-Park. Thus, you See, she has quite given me up, merely, 1 am perSuaded, from a fear of distressing me by a marriage which cannot be a lucrative, though it may be a very happy one. I am Sure, at least, that I cannot be happy without

I have shut mySelf up in my apartment theSe two days: I have taken up and laid down my pen a hundred times, since the beginning of my letter. As often have I refolved to think no more of this enchanting woman : but I find it is impossible to banish her, a moment, from my mind. Solitude only nourishes my unfortunate passion ; I will, therefore, mix with the world : and yet how very dull will every place be without Lady Lucy!—How destitute of pleasure will every Spot appear wsithout the Society of her by whoSe preSence the dullest Spot was inexpressibly enlivened !—I find a kind of lassitude creeping over me which makes life a burthen.—Had she but Ipoken to me; had she acquainted

I should think I injured Lady Lucy, who, notwithstanding her preSent coolneSs, has the tenderest assertion for me; and who cannot, I verily believe, ever be happy with any other man. What great anxiety,

for whom I cannot help. Sometimes, sighing. I am likely to be amuSed by the sight and acquaintance of MiSs PlaS-tow, -your formidable rival, my dear: we expeft her every minute, with Mr. and Mrs. Ellis, the Gentleman and Lady to whoSe care the late Lord Ashbourne left her till his Son returned to England, . and whoSe Summer residence is in this neighbourhood. I shall now have an opportunity to let you into Several little matters relating to her preSent and future conneflions with your friend;—but I hear a carriage.—I will go to fee her, and tell you, by and by, how I like her.
In Continuation.
Indeed, my dear Bell, you must take care of yourSelf. This Plastow is a charming girl. I went down, thinking,
all
The Disinterested Marriage. 165
all the way, that nothing could furpaSs Lady Bell Wallace; but you must know, my dear, that there are different kinds of beauties. LouiSa Plastow is not only striking at first, but improves upon you every moment. She is tall and Slender, and yet not too thin neither. She is the most nymphijh figure you ever beheld: her whole form is genteel, her every motion is full of grace. She has a very clear complexion, Soft, delicate, and enlivened with a beautiful glow of health. She is most amiably diffident, and makes, upon the whole, the most pittoreSque appearance imaginable. She was dressed in a white lustring negligee with pale pink ribbons, and looked quite a Hebe. Her conversation and' manners are no leSs striking than her perSon. Yet, perhaps,
. I may be partial: for she paid great
court
i66 The Disinterested Marriage.
court to me; and you are Sensible that there is nothing more Seducing than flattery.
I mentioned Lord Aflibourn to her, and told her that I heard he was a very amiable man.
She replied, she was happy in having been left under his care, and that every body Spoke well of him.
She blushed, and her eyes So prettily twinkled, while she was talking of him, that she is certainly, Some how, prepoS-Seffcd in his favour.
When she left us, she Solicited an intimacy with me, and in Such perSualive terms, that I could not have refuSed '	her request, if she had not been half So
I	pleasing
The Disinterested Marriage. 167
pleasing as she is. Besides, Mrs. Ellis is a most agreeable woman, and I wish to be acquainted with new people, if they are tolerable, in hopes of driving Frankland from my mind : but I fear that nothing I .can do will prove effectual : he will, I fear, in Spite of all my efforts, engage my thoughts more than is warrantable by discretion. I am talking of him, you See, inSenSibly : I will, however, banish him from my memory, though he is So deServedly dear to me. I will return to the amiable Plastow.— When jhe was gone, Mrs. Selby and I talked her over; my aunt told me, that she has a great many admirers ; adding, that Sir Francis Kempsfield and Mr. Fanshaw are the most agreeable of them. The latter, in particular, she Said, has a very elegant perSon, and is exceedingly accomplished. -—	He fre-
“ quently
i68 The Disinterested Marriage,
“ quently calls upon me,” continued she, “ and I dare fay you will be pleaSed “ with him.”
Thus you See, my dear, I am in a way to be amuSed, at least: new ob-jefts will, most probably, divert my attention from the only one about which 1 ought not to employ my thoughts.
• In Continuation.
1 have more chat to communicate. I have returned the fair Plastow’s visit: we are become inseparable companions. She knows but little of Lord Ashbourne,
' She tells me that she was very young v/hen he went abroad, that she never Saw' him above three times, and that he was too manly to pay any attention to Such a chit as she then was. She has
shewn
The Disinterested Marriage. i6^
shewn me a miniature of him which the. late Lord ilshbourne left her: it is So handlbme a one, that if there is a strong likeneSs between the original and the copy, Bell, I shall feel Some pity for you.
After having inSormed me, that the reSemblance was striking, MiSs Plastow very Sensibly added, that she thought the finest perfon in the world is of Small value, if it is not accompanied with a reSpecstable understanding; the latter being, in her opinion, absolutely neceffary; eSpecially, in people who have much time upon their hands, to prevent them from running into miSchief by an improper employment of it.
MiSs Plastow employs her in-a very laudable manner. She draws, plays,
VoL. I,	I	and	i
jy.o The Disinterested Marriage.
and sings with great taste. Between her first and Second visit, Mr. Fanshaw came to See Mrs. Selby, He is handSome, elegant, and genteel. There is much SenSe expressed in his face, and great foftneSs in his manners.
“ Mr. Fanshaw is quite charmed with “	Said Louifa to rsie the last time
I Saw her.
I replied, that it was not very likely he should pay any attention to me., after having been So long acquainted with her.
She blushed. Smiled, and anSwered— “ Dear Lady Lucy, do not flatter me; “ for I shall love you extravagantly if “ you do.’*
“ And
The Disinterested Marriage. 171 “ And why should you not ?” Said I.
“ rH tell you why” — replied she — “ Iwould not be too fond of any per-i-“ Son; I have So much Sensibility, that “ I am often distressed by it. 1 am apt, indeed, to be violently pleaSed; but “ then I am apt to be as violently diS-“ concerted : and were I, taking a pro-^ “ digious fancy to you.^ to be treated, in;
return, with neglefl and indifference, “ 1 should be much more pained than “ pleaSed.”
‘‘ There are Seldom any emotions be> “ tween persons of the fame Sex,” answered I; “ but as you are So liable to “ be affedled by Sudden changes, I “ would not adviSe you to fall in love.”
I z	Ler-

172 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ Perhaps your advice comes too “ late,” Said she, with her face and neck like crimSon.
This was So fair an opening to a con-' fidential conversation on her part, that I immediately Seized it; becauSe it is highly probable that I shall, ere long, languish for shmebody to talk to about Frankland.
“ So you really feel yourSelf in love ? “ and pray who is the favoured man ?”
“ There you must excuSe me,” replied she, still more diSconcerted ; “ you “ would think me a little mad, if you “ knew vrho he was.”

jedlures, in conSequence of the observations I have made, are right, Fan-shaw is the man : and I am strongly inclined to believe that she meant, by the above-mentioned addreSs to to indulge the pleaSure she felt in talking of him, and to diSguiSe her inclination for him at the fame time. However, my dearest Bell, you are Safe; and may reckon upon Lord Ashbourne as your own, though he is expedled here every hour, and though Mr. and Mrs. Ellis are preparing to receive him in the most agreeable manner.
And now can I conclude without a single word concerning poor Frankland? I muft—it is best for me to forget him; as the remembrance of him must be attended with fenSations fatal to our peace. I will, therefore, for once, be difcreet, I 3	,	and

From the fame to the fame,
I A M disturbed beyond expreshon !
I am almost distradSed ! Frankland lies dangeroussy ill of a fever. Harriot Swymmer wrote me a particular account of his alarming situation, as she received it from her brother, who goes to See him every day. 1 can hardly tell what I
write

write—I have Sent, however, to beg her to let me hear continually, by every posh how he is—If he should die, what would become of me ? Harriot has just hinted, that his disappointment with regard to me has occasioned his diSorder. Good God ! Could I but have SuppoSed him Sufficiently attached to me, to be So much disordered by my refuSal, I believe I should have been indiScreet enough to conSent to a match which must have ruined him.—As it is, I cannot tell what to do. I have desired-Harriot, however, to contrive that he may know how constantly I enquire after him, and that I am miserable about him. If my extreme concern for his Sufferings can give him the ssightest re* lief, I shall think mySelf happy.

He is out of danger; pronounced to be So at least by his physicians—Thank heaven ! I feel my heart considerably lighter. I now retract Vv^hat I have Said in the former part of my letter : I will not marry him indeed, but he shall not be acquainted with this reSolution, that his Spirits may not be too feriouQy affected by it a Second time. Poor dear fellow ! how exquisitely delightful is it to be So doated on by the man of one’s heart!
I SuppoSe
The Disinterested Marriage. 177
I fuppofe now. Bell, you want to hear of Lord Ashbourne, and I find myfelf able to communicate a few remarks I have made; happening to be preSent when he first appeared at Ellis-Grove.
While LouiSa and I were Sitting in the muSick-room, while she Sang to her lute a pathetic air, and I listened with the utmost delight, the door opened, and a very complete figure entered the room with Mr. Ellis.
f-	i
“ My Lord Ashbourne,-* Said he.
His Lordship looked at us both, bowed; then, having again Surveyed U9, he advanced to poor Mist Plastow, whoSe instrument was in the greatest danger. I really thought it ^ A' 5	“	would

Lord Ashbourne, observing the violent agitation of her Spirits, very politely relieved her, by taking the instrument out of-her hand, and -placing it upon the table,	.	■
.	'.V.	.
She blushed, and curteSied; when he made her foriie compliments upon her musical abilities, which had greatly charmed him, he Said, though he had heard them but fqr-a moment: adding, that he begged he might not give the least interruption to performances which would be highly agreeable to him.,
“ I shall be almost ^afraH, my Lord,” replied she,, in the jmost p^jitSicaLof all voices, “to attempt to perform before

“ So excellent a judge as your Lord-“ ship ; who, just arrived from the land “ of harmony, must be still leSs able “ to relish my English manner.”
He replied, that So much diffidence was a certain proof of her musical merit, and therefore intreated her to favour him with a Song,
She complied immediately; but the fear of not giving the pleaSure she wished to give, rendered her voice So tremu-^ lous, that she could hardly go through her Song, though my Lord encouraged her, by Saying every thing that could be Said upon the 'occasion. I judged however, that he looked as if he did not fay half he thought. In short. Bell,

worst at once; and really he appears to me to be very much struck with her; she, alSo, Seems to be no leSs charmed with him ; yet both of them Seem afraid to discover their feelings. There is a modesty, a diffidence and timidity in her, extremely becoming; and every woman of delicacy would shew her af-fetstion for her lover in that manner; but what could have diSconcerted Lord Ashbourne So much ? A man of his rank, fenfe and education, is Seldom embarrassed by any girl, eSpecially a girl who is his ward, and under his guidance and diredhion.—But I shall fee more in a little time, if Frankland recovers.—Should he not recover, I will not anSw'er for the intelledhs of

Lady Bell to Lady Lucy.
I Thank you for your intelligence again, Lucy; though give me leave, at the fame time, to tell you, that it is not the most agreeable in the world; and to make it still leSs palatable, I am pretty Sure it is true. Here is a Sir William Freeman who has made a strange fuSs about me. Lord Ashbourne corresponds with him. In hopes of gaining my good-will, he has promiSed to shew me all his Lordship’s letters.
It was just after I received your last, in which you gave So sine a description of MiSs Plastow, that Sir William made the above-mentioned promiSe. To con-feSs the truth sincerely, the perufal of
your
i82 The Disinterested Marriage,
your letter rendered me not a little envious and jealous. I Suffered the man, therefore, to do what he would, though I deSpiSed him in my heart at the Same time, for his treachery to his friend ! — But this love makes fools, and Something worSe, of us all, as you will find by the incloSed, which is a copy of one of Lord Ashbourne’s letters : I have transcribed it on purpoSe for you, that you may judge, by this Specimen, in what manner he will proceed. I am glad to find that he has Some conscientious qualms, and would have all men, who feel themSelves guilty of Such doubledealing, be thoroughly Sensible of their error, and make all the amends in their power.—You will, I hope, carefully read this letter, and I beg you will fend me a particular account of MiSs Pla-stow’s Sentiments about the writer of
The Disinterested Marriage. 183
it, that I may know how to condinst mySelf, with the most propriety, in an affair which requires, you will own, I bplievse, both reSolution — I was going CO Say resignation—and delicacy.
I am very Sorry that you have Suf-fored So much ioii account of Frank-land’s illnefs/ and ^ sincerely wish you may find him worth grieving for. As men go, there are few to be lamented.
'1 confeSs,. however, I am So diSgusted with the whole Sex at "pteSent, that I am not quite So candid as I ought to she-: yet I imagine that poor Ashbourne cannot help being Such a weather-cock. His letter will Serve as a clue, to find out the inclination of his new favourite. Pray let me know, as Soon as poshble, what observations you make. In re-rum, if I can be of any Service to you

LETTER XXV.
Lord Ashbourne to SirWiLLiAM Freeman, Bart.
[ IncloSed in the foregoing. ]
I Arrived here last TueSday, and have Seen this So much dreaded MiSs Pla-stow : dreaded indeed she ought to have
been
The Disinterested Marriage. 185
been by me—She has not only made me adore her., but abhor myfelf. — I, who thought Lady Bell Wallace Superior to every other woman, now think MiSs Plastow more lovely than the loveliest of her Sex. — In another week or two, perhaps, I may meet with half a dozen women still more desirable than either of theSe : yet Such is the unSettled state of my mind, that my ficklenesses and caprices must inevitably render me unworthy of any woman’s affedlion and esteem. But you ought to be previoufiy acquainted with every thing which relates to Mifs Plastow, or you may think worfe of me than I deferve: and yet you cannot entertain a worSe opinion of me than I do of my Self.
To begin then—I think Mifs Plastow ' is one of the loveliest, one of the most
elegant
186 The Disinterested Marriage.
' elegant figures I ever beheld. There is Such a Symmetry in her whole form. So much grace in her every motion. Such a lively bloom, arising from the happy combination of youth and health, in her countenance. Such a dignity in her air. Such a commanding SweetneSs in her aSpecSl: — I was absolutely struck at the first Sie;ht of her — I looked at her as at a Superior being. I can hardly tell how I behaved. So greatly was I dazzled by her charms. I felt myfelf, indeed, a mere non-entity. She, with a SweetneSs peculiar to herSelf, though it was, at the Same time, accompanied with a kind of delicate timidity, strove to re-affure me, and has since paid me the most flattering deference.—She behaves with a fubmif-five reSpedl, Sufficient to touch the most inSenSible. I have Several times endeavoured
The Disinterested Marri^^ge. 187
voured to convince her that her fub-missiveneSs is by no means necessary. •— She tells me, with Such an enchanting expression in her eyes, and Such a melting SoftneSs in her voice, that she will ever be obedient to her guardian, whom she reveres as a parent, having unfortunately lost both hers.^—Scarcely know what to Say to her, nor how to treat So fine a young creature, who is all beauty in her form, all gentleneSs in her manners. She has a crowd of admirers, yet she distinguishes no man particularly, though Some of them appear to be very accomplished, and, in point of family and fortune, unexceptionable. As most of her admirers have applied to me., I ashed her, the other day, whom she preferred, whom she favoured with her esteem.
“ Indeed,
i88 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ Indeed, my Lord,” replied she, “1 “ never gave mySelf the trouble to ex-“ amine their different merits.”
The man who is the objedt of your “ choice,” anSwered I, “ cannot be de-“ stitute of merit. You have a very “ good taste, and whoever is fortunate “ enough to be preferred by you.^ MiSs “ Plastow,” added I, with a sigh, vrhich I could not fuppreSs, which I wished not to fuppreSs, “ will be Sure of my con-currence.”
A roSy blush overSpread her fair face, at my So freely promifed confent. She turned away her charming eyes, made a silent curtSy, and abruptly left the room.
How
The Disinterested Marriage. 189
How odd was her behaviour! how very different from every other part of her condud ! how exceedingly enigmatical ! .
When we met again, a Soft kind of tender languor, which rendered her inexpressibly lovely, was distiiSed over her whole perSon, Now and then X caught her eyes fixed on mine; but she averted them immediately on my observing them, or when she Saw any body elSe take notice of them. Surely the dear, charming girl cannot be afraid of me, or do me the injustice to imagine that I shall ever wish to compel her. No—she fiiall be as free as air — she shall chuSe the man she likes, though I should die with envy at the SucceSs of the happy mortal who gains her heart. — I cannot decently leave Lady Bell, nor honestly
pretend
igo The Disinterested Matriage.
pretend to MiSs PlastOw ; for who, after having deceived one woman, can expedl to be received by another ? — I am rightly Served. I deSpiSed my father’s advice, thinking that he could not chuSe properly for me : I fancied he had no taste'—How I wronged him ! He had choSen for me the most finished creature in the uniVerSe. Slighting his intentions, and negledling, shamefully negledting to comply with his injunftions, I have, indeed, rendered myfelf wretched, and, most probably, one woman unhappy: as I really believe uhat Lady Bell has a sincere, a tender regard for me. Pray heaven defend me from throwing any more women into a similar Situation.— Should this LouiSa ! — I shudder at the thought — I dare not indulge Such an idea—L will stop here, lest I should go too far—I have already undone myfelf^ p	and

and would »ot willingly undo any body elSe.

I am half-angry with the Swymmers, however, though they meant well; and if their communications about me have been really of Service to him, I must forgive them : yet Surely Harry did not do right, in telling every thing which I wrote, in thef^height of my distreSs, to his Sister: by shewing my letter, he was certainly guilty of an indiScretion: but if the peruSal of that letter has contributed to Frankland’s recovery, I cannot fay much against it.

he is able to leave his room. I am sincerely rejoiced at his being So well as he is: I am quite in Spirits. My friend Plastow, on the other hand, is as melancholy as you can imagine a mortal to be : I wonder what is come to the poor girl, I wish your Lord Ashbourne has not made a hole in her little heart. She is attentive only to hirri; she is assiduous to pleaSe him alone, and negledls every thing she uSed to be fond of. — Perhaps she may think that her behaviour is quite calculated to make an impression upon him; and I fancy indeed that she Will be Successful; for he, on his side, is no leSs Solicitous to amule and entertain het\ though he does not openly profeSs any Such design.

“ You prefer Lord Ashbourne then

“ Why he is no lover,” Said she, colouring like Scarlet; “but I would “ not diSoblige him for the world; he “ is So good.

“ That is my terror,; there is my ^ distress. I am distradted how to adt.”
“ There is not the least diSficuky,” anSwered I, laughing; “ you have no-“ thing to do but to- tell Lord Ash-“ bourne what you have told me. He “ will then foon inform you how to “ ad.”
“ Oh ! I cannot, I cannot,” cried she, blushing.
Lord Ashbourne, at that moment, entered the room, and not a little increa'Sed both her blushes and her confusion.

I pitied the poor thing, and therefore told his Lordship that she was quite at a loSs whom to accept of for a partner.
This Simple Speech of mine aftually disconcerted him. The wiSest people. Sometimesj are puzzled to know what anSwer to return to the most foolish Ipeech imaginable.
He looked at heVy as if he wanted to discover in her eyes the wished-for information — “ Are you not determined,’* Said he, with a languishing air, and taking her hand, which he looked at as if he thought it the whitest and Softest in the univerSe (it is a very handSome one) whom you shall honour by choosing him for your partner ?’^

After a fever which almost brought me to the brink of the grave, I am again able to hold my pen.
For

For my recovery, I am indebted to that dear angel Lady Lucy, who, upon, hearing I was ill, wrote a letter to Harriet Swymmer, Sufficient to convince me that she loves me extremely : and yet she refuSes to make me happy, merely from an apprehension of making me miserable. Dear creature! how I doat on her! To So great a degree, indeed, do I doat on her, that I must think of Some means to improve my fortune, in order to be able to procure a competency for us.—Heavens! to talk of a competency for a fine young woman of quality ! What a strange father had she, to fell her in So Scandalous a manner!—How fervently do I sigh for a fortune equal to my wishes, and to See her without a shilling, that I might convince her of the Sincerity, the disinterestedness of my passion for her! I long to behold her, K 6	to

to throw mySelf at her feet, to thank her for the preservation of a life which must ever be devoted to her alone : but she forbids me either to visit her, or to write to her: Yet, Surely, on Such an occasion as this, 1 may venture to break through rules which are in the highest degree abSurd. It is impossible to keep them; and yet this dear girl expefls me to conform to them.—Charming, unreasonable creature !—I zvilI I muji See her, if it be only to pour out my ac-knov/ledgments. — I could write ; but words are too tame, too languid to ex-preSs the feelings of my heart: they can only be read in the eyes, only felt in the throbbings of my breast, in every bounding pulSe, at her approach. The . bare idea of meeting her fills me with SenSations neither to be defined nor described ; and occasions an inconceivable

I wish you could See her dear letter : I begged it of Harriot Swymmer, as if I had been begging for my life; but she, peremptorily, refuSed me; telling me, at the fame time, that I should not have Seen it at all, had she not, fearing I should never recover, been willing to make me as happy as I couU be in this world. Thus, you fee, I was upon the point of entering into another worlds before this kind creature would stretch out her friendly hand to Save me. I will, therefore, See my Lucy, and Soon too : for I shall not think my health perfecstly reestablished, till I have Spoken with the dear cauSe of my diSorder.

Lady Lucy to Lady Bell.
My dear, dear Bell, how I have been shocked, and frightened ! terrified to death, at the unexpedled appearance of Frankland, pale and emaciated ! yet he looked alSo inexpressibly amiable, and endearingly tender. He has almost undone me. The furprife I felt at the sight of him is not to be described.
While I was sitting, alone, in the breakfast-parlour, reading Thompson’s works—Mrs. Selby was gone out in the chariot — John opened the door, and told me that a Gentleman from London was arrived.
Scarce
The Disinterested Marriage. 207
Scarce had he announced this Lon-don-Gentleman, when he appeared.— Erankland appeared.
I Screamed with terror and amazement : but nobody minded me. The agreeable wretch advanced rapidly to the couch on which I Sat, Seized me in his arms, and embraced me So cloSely, that I really thought he would have deprived me of my breath.
“ Good God ! Mr. Frankland,” exclaimed 1, breaking from him, “ how “ came you here ^ how could you venture ?”—I Saw plainly, indeed, that he was So weak he could hardly stand; that he could hardly articulate a Single Syllable.—He could only just get out—
I am come to thank you”—and then
Sunk.
2o8 The Disinterested Marriage.
Sunk into a chair in a state of infensibi-lity.
You may imagine what I felt—I actually believed that I Saw him ready to expire.
Sitting down by him, I hurried out my Salts, and put them into one of his poor, cold hands, while I rubbed the other as briSkly as I could, not knowing what in the world to do with him— I was quite wild with impatience to See him recover—I committed a thouSand follies, I SuppoSe : I Said fo many good-natured things to him, purely to comfort him, that he aSolutely fell into raptures— and talked very madly. — He insisted on my conSenting to be his immediately ; vented a vast quantity of nonSenSe about living in a cottage upon

love, and Swore So vehemently, he would not leave me till I had Solemnly promised to give him my hand in leSs than a fortnight, that I began to fear he had brought on his fever again by his raving, and was delirious.
You cannot conceive the terrifying situation in which I felt mySelf—Finding it altogether neceffary to coax him— for I began to be afraid cf him, and for him—-I Said—“ Now do, let me prevail “ on you, Mr. Frankland, to go qui-“ etly home : you want rest: this jour-“ ney has been too much for you: how “ could you undertake it ? an& alone “ too ? but I will fend a Servant with “ you.”
“ I wish you would go with me your-y Self.”

“ How can you talk So ?’* replied I: “ Such a thing is, yoii know, imprac-“ ticable: do, therefore, compoSe your* “ Self—Let me intreat you, Mr. Frank-land,’* continued I, still Soothing him.
“ Am I really your Frankland answered he, looking wildly at me, and graSping my hands with a kind of tender violence — “ You do not Speak, “ Lady Lucy —• you do not Say that I am your Frankland. And yet, whe-“ ther you Say it, or even wish it or “ not, I am years alone, wholly yows^ “ and must continue So to my latest “ breath—My dearest creature,” added he, claSping me again to his boSom in Such an ecstaSy, Such a delirium of joy,, that I could not help Smiling at the violence of his behaviour; though I was,

at the fame time, every way hurt by it. My Smiles threw him into fresh raptures. He grew quite romantic.
“ What charming, what tender- ex-preshon beams in thoSe dear eyes! ” cried he, looking at me with Such meaning in his own, that I was both affected and frighted ; and I could not^ once, help faying, — “ Do, my dear Frankland, leave me now: you are “• really by no means right; you will bring on your fever again.—-Come, ‘‘ you Jhall go home.” .

on him to stir ; I really feared too that he was light-headed. — Luckily, while I was embarrassed, my aunt returned.— Being informed that Frankland was in the parlour, she came in out of compliment to me.^ to welcome him. I in-treated her to stay with me, and with her assistance, at last I prevailed on him to get into the carriage, after having made him take Some refreshment, and insisted upon his letting John go behind it, to See him Safe to town, and to bring me word how he left him. All this Seemed to pleaSe him exceedingly ; but when, to prevent any future jour-nies of the fame kind, I told him very fcrioussy, calling Mrs. Selby to witneSs wiiat I Said, that, till my fortune was mended, I would never more See him, he changed colour, and trembled So much, that I was atstually on the point
of
The Disinterested Marriage. 213
of recalling my words. I could not, however, help adding, that he might depend upon my reServing mySelf for him alone, but that there were a number of reafons just nov/ for my intreating him not to desire what I could not poS-fibly comply with. He appeared to have still a mind to expostulate, but Mrs. Selby and I looking as if we really both wished him fairly out of the houSe;, he took his leave at last, yet with So violent an embrace, that I thought he would have quite devoured me. He muji be disordered in his head: poor dear fellow ! he never ufed to take Such liberties. How very much do I pity him! Indeed, Bell, I am extremely unhappy, for this last interview has made him a thouSand times worSe than ever: but I ought not So tire you perpetually with my astairs, and I have no

letter XXX.
Lord Ashbourne to Sir William Freeman.
i
[IncloSed in the foregoing.]
WH AT a situation am I in ! a situation which would make most men quite happy, but it has thrown me into the greatest perplexity.
VoL, I.	L	Plastow,
2i8 The Disinterested Marriage.
Plastow, this amiable, this charming Plastow, certainly prefers me to all her admirers.—A most animating certainty, you will fay—I find it far otherwise; and yet, after all, perhaps I only fancy she prefers me,—We are very apt to realize our wishes.—Surely, however, I cannot be Such a coxcomb as to deceive mySelf So egregioussy; butjy<?zi, who are impartial, you shall hear, and judge.
She came down • a few days ago with a miniature on her arm. Set with brilliants, but bound only with a piece of black velvet; yet nothing could have made the Snowy SoftneSs of the siesh appear to greater advantage. I was half distracted to know who was happy e-nough to be So distinguished.—Then curbing my impetuous fancy, I began to think it might be the portrait of her
father.
The Disinterested Marriage. 219
father, or mother, or Some other relation. However, I advanced to Satisfy my curiosity.—GueSs my astonishment to sind a miniature of mySelf.
We both blushed.
Taking hold of one of the finest hands in the world, I tenderly pressed it. The charming girl endeavoured to make Some apology, by telling me that my father had left it her.—A good memento, thought I, with regard to other legacies still dearer, still more valuable. I only kindly anSwered, that since she did me So much honour as to wear my reSemblance, I begged her to render it a more desirable ornament, by the acceptance of a string of pearls, as I had Seen no arm which would shew them to Such advantage.
L 2	She
220 The Disinterested Marriage.
She Smiled, blushed, cast down her Sweet eyes, and Said she was greatly o-bliged to me.
Charming creature! I had the transporting pleaSure to See her wear them the next day. In short, she does every thing to ple*aSe me, to fix my heart for ever: and yeti dare not think of her.
I have already engaged mySelf; I have given my promiSe to another; I must be a villain, therefore, to pretend to her. The very idea makes me quite sick; my head turns round.
In Continuation.
I am So out of Spirits, So very much disordered, that I know not what to do with mySelf. I am So incapable, alSo, of
con-
The Disinterested Marriage. 221-
concealing my uneaSineSs, that I am become utterly unfit for Society.
What an angel is this LouiSa! She Sees my inability to Support mySelf under the preffure of my diSquietudes; she fees how Severely I am distreffed, by not being able to make advantage of the delightful partiality she hourly diScovers for me. I have been So dejecled, So pitied, indulged, and attended to, that I can never continue much longer here. I shall undo her, mySelf, Lady Bell, and every body.
I Scarcely Spoke all day, yesterday; LouiSa followed me about, enquired over and over where my pain lay, offered me her eau de luce bottle, and fetched me flowers to Smell to ; and when she Saw me, after dinner. So little in a condition L 3	to

to Sustain a part of the conversation, as to retire into the next room, she came after me. There, with the most perSua-five looks, and in the most melting accents, she desired me to try to steep.
I told her it was impossible for me to clofe my eyes.
“ Recline on this Sofa, then,” Said she, “ and I will sing to you with my y lute, or read you to rest.’’
1 complied with her good-natured proposals, merely becauSe she So earnestly Solicited my assent to them; becauSe I receive the highest SatisfaDion from giving her pleaSure, and becauSe I could not resist the enchanting delight I felt in giving her an opportunity to shew me how far her friendship would carry

her. Throwing mySelf, therefore, immediately upon the Sofa, I desired her to sit down in a chair by me. She then took up her lute, and Sung in So ravishing a style, that I could hardly keep my * transports within bounds.—I pretended, however, to try to Sleep, and covered my face with my hand ; by So doing I Saw all her proceedings through my fingers.
When she had finished her Song, she laid down her lute Softly on the table, perceiving me lie very quiet, and fat down again by me, looking at me with the greatest tenderneSs. Now and then a gentle sigh heaved her lovely boSom : yet she did not stir.—Pretending, at last,, to be fast asseep, I let my head drop lower on the cushion, still, however,
L 4	keeping ,
224 The Disinterested Marriagt,
keeping mySelf in a position to behold her beauties.
When I had been for Some time in that situation, she roSe foftly, as I did not move, came nearer to me, and at length knelt down in order to examine me more cloSely.-—Flesh and blood could not bear this.—To See her So near me, to feel her breath upon my cheek! —Oh ! there was no enduring it.—'I removed my hand from my face, and in-stantaneousiy—involuntarily I may Say, threw it round her neck.
Starting back, she looked abashed, alarmed; yet, at the Same time, was, evidently, not diSpleaSed, though it was certainly necessary for her to appear So. She attempted to riSe, but I gently detained her, while I read every tender
passion
The Disinterested Marriage. 22^

“ I have indeed,” replied she, covered with blushes of a deeper dye, “ nobody to blame but myfelf—but I “ went to look at—I mean I dropped “ Something, I believe,” continued she, totally diSconcerted.—“ Pray ex-“ cuSe me, my Lord,” concluded she, —and rushed out of the room.
Is it not plain now. Freeman, that she is far from being indifferent about rne ? But I have a still more unquestionable proof of her prepossession in my favour.
Being very restlefs, and wretched indeed, I went after her. I found her

Sitting down by her, I took her hand again.—“ You are not quite angry with “ me, my dear MiSs Plastow, I hope ?”
I am angry with nobody but my-“ Self, my Lord.”
“ You will not be angry at ail, then, ■ “ Madam,” anSwered 1; “as no woman ■ “ can possibly condud herSelf with “ greater propriety.”
She Sighed, she blushed, she withdrew her hand.—Then looking at me earnestly, she gave it to me again. I Seized it with tranSport, and pressed it to my lips with an ardour fully Sufficient to convince her that I feel the warmest L 6	passion

LETTER XXXL Lady Lucy ta Lady Bel l.-
IAm Set down to tell you, what you So earnestly desire to know, MiSs Plastow’s Sentiments concerning her lover. I can gratify curiosity with the greatest eaSe, as she has opened every fold of her little heart to me, without giving me the trouble to diScover mine.
While I was fitting, a few days ago, in one of the temples in the garden, she came in the prettiest stutter of Spirits, i-maginable, and throwing herSelf down by me. Said she had brought her work, - and was come to chat with, me. She then took out her work, but appeared
to

to be in great confusion, and Seemed hardly to know what she was about.
“ How is Lord Ashbourne ?’* Said I, careleSsIy.
She blushed excessively, and replied, that he was not at all well.
Seeing that she had a desire to talk of him, I gave her all decent encouragement.
“ He is a very Sensible man,” continued I.
This Set her a going.
“ Only the moft amiable of men,” anSwered she, echoing, “ I have ever ^ met with.”

“ I don’t know that,” Said she, very much embarrassed. “ People may be too agreeable Sometimes.”
“ Surely that is, impossible,” replied I, laughing.
“ Not at all.—I wish I could think So :—but I fear I shall find Lord Ash-bourne too pleasing.”
“ There is no harm, my dear,” Said I, “ in being pleaSed with people of “ merit; and Lord Ashbourne has cer-“ tainly a considerable share.”
“ You

“ though your modesty will not let you " think So.”
“ Oh ! you do not know,. Lady Lu-“ cy, how ridiculouily I have behaved; “ but, indeed, I could no way help it. “ I felt an irresistible impulSe, urging “ me beyond a possibility of retreat. “ You cannot imagine what I have done. “ No woman should ever let a man read her Sentiments about him, be-“ fore he has made a declaration in her favour.

“ Oh! ” replied she, “ I was So af-“ fedted by his indiSpoSition—but I do “ not know how to tell you—and yet I “ will try.—Being extremely hurt by his “ continual complaints, his continual . “ dejedtion, I availed mySelf of every “ Soothing art to relieve him ; I begged “ him to try to steep while I Sung to “ him—My efforts Succeeded ; he fell “ faSt asteep, as I imagined, and I was “ then tempted to take a little nearer “ view of him.—You know he is very

I broke from him, at “ last, and hurried away. He followed “ me, begged my pardon, and was So “ reSpedlful, So tender, that I did not “ know what to Say to him.”
“ You

“ You are now, then, upon the foot-“ ing of lovers.? ” Said I, interrupting her.
“ Oh I no V replied she, drawing up a little, ‘‘ we are not: Lord Ashbourne, ‘‘ indeed, has a right to pretend to me. “ —He had his own father’s and my father’s leave—What then can hinder “ him, if he has really an inclination ?— If he has not,” added she, with a Swelling sigh, “ why then — he ought “ not to take the notice of me he has “ done. He ought not to feed me with “ hopes that are never to be attended “ with Succefs.”
Here a few tears started from her eyes, and rolled down her pretty face.
The

The gentleman in question immediately appeared.—He told her, by way of apology for his abruptneSs, that Mrs. Ellers had just heard of the unex-pedled coming of Some company to dinner. — Mrs. Ellers,” continued he, “ thought it would be agreeable to “ you to know this intelligence in time, “ and was going to diSpatch a Ser-“ vant; but I desired I might Save her “ that trouble—” He then, advancing nearer towards LouiSa, law the tears still trembling in her eyes—^With a look exquisitely tender, he took her hand.— “ What is the matter, my dear LouiSa Said he.
“ Nothing, my Lord,” anSwered'.De, pulling away her hand hastily—“Nq-“ thing,” added she, turning Srom him.
This
The Disinterested Marriage. 237
This coolneSs hurt him, I perceived, exceedingly. He Seized her hand, however, again, though I was preSent, and Said Something to her in a low key— but in Soothing, in affe<9;ionate accents.
A Second time she drew her hand from him, came to rngj and took hold of my hand.
Thus, repeatedly distanced, he made no more attempts of the Same kind, but sighed, and looked as if he was quite undone; for she kept up a referve— while I staid at least—which prevented * any appearance of a reconciliation : yet her train all Seem to think themSelves in a hopeleSs condition, Fanshavv, the prettiest fellow among them, would fain enlist liimSelf in my Service, but no man ever can Supplant Frankland; though, to do Fanshaw justice, he has every requisite

quisite to pleaSe, with that very neceS-Sary addition, a large, independent fortune, which will be entirely at my diS-poSal, he tells Mrs. Selby, on my deigning to honour him with my hand. Mrs. Selby is a strong advocate for Fanshaw, but I can never take my heart from his powerful rival, and bestow it on another. I would not, on any account, give Frank-land reaSon to charge me with a dishonourable conduct, were I not So sincerely attached to him as I am.—We complain of the fickleneSs of the men— too many of our Sex encourage them to be So by their own caprice. However, though I can never love Fanshaw, I cannot possibly deny him my esteem. He deServes every thing indeed, as he behaves in a noble, disinterested manner. When he sirst made his addresses to me, his behaviour was particularly genteel: a	he
The Disinterested Marriage. 239
he opened them with an apology for the abruptness of his carriage, assuring me, at the fame time, that he should not have ventured to Speak upon the Subjedt, near as it was to his heart, had he not been credibly informed I had re-jedbed a very amiable man, under the influence of the most generous motives. — “ Struck with you at first sight,” continued he, “ I could not help wish-ing that I had known you before I at-“ tached mySelf to MiSs Plastow: and “ I hope that I shall not be lowered in “ your opinion, by faying that I should “ not have left her.^ had I not found it “ out of my power to touch her heart.”
I assured him, in return, that I admired his frankneSs, but repeatedly declared I could only bestow my esteem on him.
He

He replied, that it should be the study of his life to deServe the continuance of it, and begged I would not re-fuSe him opportunities to improve his acquaintance with me.
I neither granted nor rejedted that request; we are, therefore, rather upon an intimate footing.
In Continuation.
Poor Frankland has had a relapSe,in consequence, I fear, of his hasty visit to me: he is, however, a Second time out of danger. I really Suffer exceedingly upon his account. In the midst of my distresses occasioned by Dr returning diSorder, I was persecuted with fresh Solicitations from Lord Grassington, whom Mrs. Selby, when I did not in the least exped him,
admitted
The Disinterested Marriage. 241
admitted to me. I was both grieved, and out of humour, at having just heard of Frankland’s relapSe, and therefore gave my Lord a very indifferent reception indeed. I believe I was more fretful and peevish than I have ever been since he first Saw me. My peevishneSs So diSgusted him to a degree; So much w:as he offended at it, that finding he could make nothing of me, he retired, and left me at liberty to indulge my own melancholy and diScontent. Fan-shaw, feeing me in a state bordering upon deSpair, in his opinion, exerted him-Self greatly to amuSe me; but his endeavours were not attended with the desired SucceSs. I am under considerable obligations to him, however, Sor the pains he has taken to pleafe me; and I have tried to expreSs my acknowledgements in the most grateful terms. My VoL. I,	M	acknow-

LETTER XXXII.
Mr. Frankland to Mr. DesborouchS
I Have been prevented from anfwering your letter by a return of my fever: it still hangs about me, and makes me unfit for every thing.
Lady Lucy, who corresponds with MiSs Swymmer, has expressed great concern at my illneSs, and Says that I increased it by coming down to Selby-Park before I was well enough to undergo the fatigue of Such a journey. Part of this, I believe, is true, as my Spirits were So violently agitated at the sight of her.^ after she had fpoken So tenderly about me to Harriet Swymmer, that the shock, weak as my condition then was, too much affedted me. However, though M ' 2	^ it
244 The Disinterested Marriage.
it is very evident that Lady Lucy loves me, she will, on no account, conSent to an union with me : an union which must, she Says, effedlually ruin us both. Yet she declares, at the siime time, that, had she not lost the greatest part of her fortune, she would marry me to-morrrow. ^ There is a Satisfaction, indeed, in hearing of that declaration —but she is too generous—she will never, she Says, di-streSs the man whom she loves. I tell her, that the diScloSure which I made of my passion for her was entirely occasioned by that lofs, as I never should have preSumed to addrefs her, had I not thought we were more on a level by ic, —All l ean Say, however, is to no pur-poSe—I cannot prevail on her to agree to the accomplishment of my wishes. 1 hardly think it right, indeed, to be too pressing. No—my estate is much too
trifling
• The Disinterested Marriage. 245
trifling for the provision of a woman of her birth and connexions: and she cannot, without degrading herSelf, think of -being united to the owner of it.—But then, on the other hand, I cannot help wishing, that I had never been acquainted with So desirable a creature.—A female companion, stis true, was ever the ardent desire of my heart; I have met with one who has every charm, personal and intelleXual, to make me Supremely blest : but—we are not destined to be happy with each other—Without * her I cannot now be happy : happineSs, therefore, in this world, I ceaSe to ex-peX.'—My health is in a very uncertain state ; and it is more than probable, that I may never enjoy its re-establishment.— Yet, as the dear cauSe of all my Sufferings has been kind enough to intreat me to take care of my health, and as my
physi-

physicians assure me that nothing but change of air, and exercife, can give me a chance for recovering ; I am de-• termined to go down; and exijf upon ^ my estate, as long as I am able to remain in the world. 1 cannot hope to live, that is, to have any relish for life, without her, by whom alone life can be rendered eligible.
Yours, &c. &c.

LETTER XXXin.
Lady Lucy to Lady Bell.
Frank LAND is gone down to Oak-Abbey to live, without having taken leave of me; without having even desired to fee me. He has removed
every
The Disinterested Marriage. 247
every kind of thing that belonged to him in London, as if he never designed to fee it again. I felt mySelf offended at this precipitate, this unadviSed step; as I Supposed it to be—like a giddy, thoughtleSs creature, as I am. I mentioned it to Harriet Swymmer, She told me in reply, that he went entirely by order of his physician, who thought him in great danger.
You cannot think how I was stuttered by this anSwer. If Frankland should' not recover, I shall be vain enough to imagine mySelf accessary to his death : that will absolutely kill me. My heart shrinks at the bare idea of it. I believe I should be quite in deSpair, did not Fanshaw’s company relieve me : he gives up his whole time to me, he amuSes me ; •— that is, he endeavours to amuSe I	me-—

24S The Disinterested Marriage. '
me—I cannot be amuSed : I have no relish for any thing. I, still, accuSe my-Self, perpetually—or rather accuSe my untoward fate, which will not let me be happy.—My poor dear fellow too, his. fate Seems to be equally untoward. The only uSe I make of Fanshaw is, to talk ^ to him continually of Frankland ; and he listens to me, he encourages me, with a patience which is very uncommon ; it is, however, very pleasing : yet he will never Succeed with me, whatever he may think. I find I cannot live without F'rankland: if, therefore, he should not get well, you may reckon me among the incurables alSo.

Lady Lucy to Lady Bell.
In Continuation.
O U want, I SuppoSe, to hear ^ Y ^ more about Lord Ashbourne * LouiSa tells me she a-voids him as much as possible ; and I fancy she Speaks the truth; for she looks extrem.ely dejedted: we are all in-indeed out of Spirits here: should you, therefore, come among us you would be VoL. II.	B	infedled

infecsted by our melancholy, if you have not already caught it. Yet i think you had better come : I will give up Fan-shaw to you. As you Seem, both, to be disappointed exaftly in the Same manner, you may very well administer conSolation to each other.
Do you know that I, frequently, keep open my letters, in hopes of hearing Something more entertaining to add ?—
I have now, by So doing, an opportunity to Send you a little anecdote concerning Lord Ashbourne and MiSs Pla- ' stow, which may be of Service to you.
Yesterday I made a visit sto Mrs. Ellis.
1 ouiSa, who was in her dreshng-roo.m. Sent to let me know that she was not well, and to beg me to come up stairs.
I obeyed
The Disinterested Marriage. 3
1 obeyed her Sumrnons, and found her Sitting quite in an undreSs with her eyes Swelled with crying, while her little heart was ready to burst with grief.
I could not help exclaiming at the fight of her in So afflided a condition, and enquiring into the cauSe of it.
“ Oh, my dear Lucy!” replied she; “ I was right when I told you that Lord “ Ashbourne could never be any thing “ more to me, than my guardian.”
“ Why not, my dear ?” Said 1; “ you “ only fancy So : I am Sure Lord Ash-
bourne is in love with you.”
“ So he tells me,” anSwered she, with a charming Simplicity. “ He tells me “ he loves me; but still that signifies B 2	nothing :
4 The Disinterested Marriage,
“ nothing: and yet he has behaved So “ Sweetly—I will inform you of the “ whole affair. I had great reaSon, you “ know, to be diSpleaSed both with him “ and mySelf. I thought I had been “ much too forward, and that he had “ given me improper encouragement: “ I, therefore, reSolved to corredl both; “ in doing which, I was, necessarily, “ obliged to behave with much cool-“ neSs : I appeared indifferent, when I “ was, really, far from being So. Lord “ Ashbourne complained of my indif-“ ference in very reSpeClful terms, and “ desired to know if he had, inadver-“ tently, done any thing to offend “ me. I made a flight anSwer, I be-“ sieve, and was going to leave him. “ He then caught me by the gown, as “ I had withdrawn my hand, and cried «« .—Stay only one moment, MiSs Pla-*	“ stow.
The Disinterested Marriage. 5
“ stow. I am not So guilty as I may “ appear to you ; I am very unfor-“ tunate.—Do but condeScend to hear “ me. — His voice, his air, his adions, “ all concurred to increaSe the pity I “ could not help feeling for him, and “ made me silently conSent to what he “ So earnestly desired.—I was, indeed, “ but too willing to hear what he had “ to Say upon a Subjed which had given “ me an infinite deal of imeaSmeSs. “ Sitting down by me, he then la-“ mented, in the most pathetic lan-“ guage, his not having had patience “ till he Saw me ; for having, before he “ Saw me, made a Surrender of his heart: “ adding, that, ignorant of the charms “ I possessed—[pray pardon me. Lady “ Imcy, for mentioning encomiums on “ mySelf'—we are all, naturally, affed-ed by flattery] he had met with Lady B 3	“ Bell

“ Bell Wallace in Flanders. — Next “ to ycu^ continued he. Lady Bell is “ the woman whom I most admire; “ and I So far proved a SucceSsful lover,
, “ that she, at length, promiSed to be “ mine, if I could decently bi-eak off “ my engagement with — I assured ‘Cher that I would break it off; and “ came now to England for that pur-“ poSe : but when I beheld you in all “ your lovelineSs, I could think no more “ of Lady Bell, or of any other woman. “ Severely did I cenSure my precipita-“ tion, for having laid mySelf under any ties before I Saw you, for whom my father designed me, as you appeared “ in my eyes So much Superior to every “ woman I had Seen. However, as I “ have no fault to find with Lady Bell, “ who has ever conduced herSelf with the greatest propriety, and with a de-
“ licacy
The Disinterested Marriage. 7
“ licacy too that ought to be acknow-ledged, I cannot adt an infamous part “ by deSerting her, without giving rea-“ Sons which may render her Satisfied “ with my behaviour : but I shall ne~
“ ver, perhaps, be Satisfied with it, ex-“ cept you, MiSs Plastow, can forgive “ my unhappy inadvertency, and bring “ yourSelf to accept of me, if I am given “ up by Lady Bell. Yet how can I aSk “ for Such a favour i* Is it possible for “ the charming MiSs Plastow to accept “ of a rejefted man ?—^No—I cannot,
“ dare not Solicit Such a favour : stiff “ lefs dare I hope to enjoy So exquisite “ a bleffing. — Here he stopped, with “ his eyes fixed on my face, v/hile his ^ “ hand graSped mine with a vehemence “ which discovered the strong agitation “ of his mind : I was almost dissolved “ in Sorrow; tears streamed down my B 4	“ cheeks; >
8 The Disinterested Marriage,
“ cheeks; I Sobbed aloud—I could not Speak.—He appeared greatly alarmed “ at my Situation. Throwing himSelf “ upon his knees before me, he took “ my hands in his, laid his face on them, “ and aSked m.e, with inexpressible ten-“ derneSs, why I wept; adding, that “ my tears gave him the most cutting “ diSquiet. —I could not help owning that I lamented our not having met “ Sooner, when we were both not only at liberty to love, but encouraged to “ preSer each other to all the world, by “ thoSe who had a right to dire<st and “ adviSe us : I could not help owning “ too, that the pleaSure I had felt in “ knowing I was beloved by him, was *• cruelly lessened by the consideration “ that we were never to meet—without “ Lady Bell’s refuSal.—Thus you See, “ my dear Lady Lucy,” continued the
amiable
The Disinterested Marriage. ^
amiable girl, “ there are no hopes of “ our ever being happy, as it is not at “ all probable that Lady Bell should “ conSent to resign So charming a man “ to her rival.”
Not being able to dive into your Sentiments upon this SubjedS, I could not give LouiSa any hopes, at the conclusion of her unreServed diSclofures. I know how I should a6l my Self in Such circumstances—I think 1 know what I should do in Such a situation: but when an enchanting fellOw is become master of our hearts, reaSon, I fear, has little influence: love reigns over us with a tyrannic Sway.—Poor Frankland! how I wish to hear that he is better! how I wish to have it in my power to make him as happy as he deServes to be.—•

LETTER XXXIV.
Mr. Frank-land to Mr. Desborough.
I Thank you for your concern, and for your anxiety about me, though they will be of no advantage to me, as I think I am pretty far gone in an incurable distemper; but as it is one of the flattering kind, I am the more compoSed under it; for though I belie,ye I really grow worSe, I am frequently weak enough to fancy I am better.
When
The Disinterested Marriage, i i
When I first came down here, I took great pleaSure in planting. Sowing, and improving my little estate; hoping, that if I could ever make an advantageous change in it. Lady Lucy might be tempted to confent to our mutually enjoying the profits ariSing from it; as Ido adually think it is possible for two people to be happy in this Sequestered Spot, even after having Seen hetter days, I am not, however, a mere foUtary: I have neighbours who most earnestly court my acquaintance; but since the loSs of her in whom alone my Soul delighted, I am become averSe to any Society, and glide away at the fight of a human creature, like a ghost at the approach of morning. I hear that I am complimented with the title of the handSome phantom—What trifiing is this, however, in a man who is, per-B 6	haps,

12 The Disinterested Marriage.
haps, near his end ! — As Lady Lucy attaches herfelf to Fanshaw, the Sooner I am removed out of a world in which I have no buSineSs, the better. Yet— heaven is my witnefs, I do not, cannot blame her. I ever wished her to be happy, and, if the charader given to me of this gentleman is a just one, he is thoroughly capable of making her So. As she is now cured of the partiality with which she once honoured me, a favour entirely unmerited, a fa^ vour never to be Sufficiently acknowledged, I cannot possibly ever repay it. I can only make a poor attempt towards the payment, by leaving her all I poS-SeSs: that aU is too little to be worth her acceptance: but I cannot leave her any more : yet what I can leave her will, I hope, in Some meaSure make up for the ungenerous behaviour of Lord GraSs-

He has afled with an apparent mcanneSs, I am convinced, merely with a hope, merely with a view to obtain the possession of a woman who would tempt almost any man to be guilty of all forts of crimes, to gain her heart.

IH A V E received a letter of Frank-land’.s to a friend, incloSed in one of Harriot Swymmer’s to me, which has shaken all my wife reSolves, and will Send me down with expedition to Oak-Abbey, to Superintend the dairy, while he manages the farm. In short. Bell, the poor dear fellow is in a decline, and fancies that I am going to be married to Fanshaw, and talks of making his will. I shall certainly loSe him for ever, if I do not hasten to relieve him.
You will tell me, perhaps, that I shall repent of this rash, unadviSed step : but pray be quiet, child ; I am of age,

and hold my Self wife enough to know what will make me happy: and as for the opinion of others, I give it to the winds. I would rather stand the ridicule of the brightest circle at court; I would rather be shunned by the men, and Sniffed at by the women, than give a moment’s pain to the honest, generous heart, which sincerely loves me. No, Bell: I will throw off the fine Lady, and put on the farmer’s wife: but I must hurry, or elSe it will be too late, and the poor fellow will be quite gone. I would not come upon him too Suddenly neither; yet I must-be expeditious. I will not Send for him hither—I will go to Oak-Abbey my-Self. Mrs. Selby, who has talked very Serioussy upori this Subjed, has promiSed to accompany me. The Swymmers too must be of the party. What a Strange
Scheme!

LETTER XXXVI.
Mr. Frankland to Mr. Desborouch.
WHAT transporting joy! Lucy, my dear Lady Lucy, has been here. Never was SurpriSe equal to mine, at
the
The Disinterested Marriage. 17
the sight of her. I was above half a a mile from the houSe, feeing my fellows load a cart with a Second crop of hay. Robert, hurrying up to me, quite out of breath, informed me that a coach full of company had drove into my court-yard,
“ Company ! ” Said I, eagerly.
“ Yes, Sir,” replied he, “ three La-“ dies, and a Gentleman: they are “ come to dinner; for they ordered the “ coachman to Set up at the best houfe “ in the village: I told them that we “ had room in our stables.”
What an officious raScal! thought I—To fay the truth. Jack, I found myfelf in no Sort of humour for visiters, nor was I, by any means, prepared for
their
iS The Disinterested Marriage..
their reception. So totally indeed was I unfit to See them, that I could almost have quarrelled with my Servant for having admitted them.—Before I thought of ashing who they were, he prevented me, by telling me that the Gentleman’s name was Swyramer ; that there was a MiSs Swymmer, and a Lady Lucy Something, he could not tell what—Robert ' is quite a country fellow : I did not chuSe to bring any man from town with me, well knowing that your London Servants are much too lazy to be of any Service here,..
The name of Lady Lucy startled rne a little. I must have been half distracted to have expeCled a visit from her; yet I Sighed, I wished, I felt inexpressible emotions at the bare mention of her.
While
The Disinterested Marriage. 19
While I was lost in a reverie entirely on her account, she appeared before me.
.Surpriled as I had been at the mention of her name, I was now agitated in a manner not to be deScribed. I hastened to meet her: jhe alSo quickened her steps. When she came nearer, she held out her hand to me. I feiSed it with eagerneSs, and pressed it to my boSom, to my lips.
“ Lady Lucy ! ” Said I, with a faint voice, hardly to be heard, “ what hap-
pineSs to See you ! ”
“ Frankland,” replied she, with a blushing timidity, which gave her a thouSand additional charms, “ I am “ come—’’
^	Here
20 The Disinterested Marriace.
Here she stopped.
“ You are come,” anSwered I, “ to “ make me the happiest of men—
I was proceeding, but she interrupted me.
“ I am indeed, if it is still in;- my: “ power.”
“ Every thing is in your power,” cried I, transported.
“ I fear you over-rate it,” Said she, with a modest tenderneSs in her eyes— “ Tell me—can I do any thing to-re-
store your health ? ”
l
“ You can restore my peace,” replied!, catching her to my boSom;
“ you.
The Disinterested Marriage. 21
“ you can give me life and hap^ineSs “ by giving me yourSelf.”
Take me then,” anSwered she: and
pray heaven I may not have given my-“ Self too late! ”
Imagine my joy, Deshorough—I cannot deScribe it—I only know that I expressed it by rapturous embraces, and by a Swift Succession of Swelling sighs. Sufficient to convince her more forcibly than a thouSand words, how exquisitely dear she was to my doating heart.
She too remained Silent, while a tear of SenSibility stole down her glowing cheek.
I kissed it off, and then aSked the meaning of. it.
“ Are
,	22 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ Are not my terrors concerning’ “ your health,” replied she, “ strong “ enough to make me extremely anxious “ about it V*
“ Banish all your terrors,” Said I, “ my health will Soon be re-established, “ as my mind is now at eaSe.”
The dear amiable creature, pleaSed with my affurances. Soon reSumed her wonted chearfulneSs; and, after having declared her determination to be mine, as Soon as every thing could be Settled, desired me to return with her to the friends of us both who had accompanied her, and who had expressed great Satisfadlion at our approaching union.
“ I made an opposition to Lucy,” Said Mrs. Selby, “ merely to give her
“ time

The Disinterested Marriage. 23
time to refiedl: on what she was about;
■“ but 1 now confeSs that you are both “ very uncommon charadlers, and can-not fail of happineSs, becauSe your “ plan of life is So unfashionably ra- j “ tional.’*
I thanked her for her good opinion, entertained all my friends in the best manner I was able, and kept them till late in the evening. I then insisted upon going with them part of the way home, on horSeback.— Swymmer was So considerate as to resign his place in the coach to me, and rode my horSe, till my tender Lucy, fearing it might be dangerous for me to return with only one Servant, would not let me go So far as I had designed. I am now preparing to attend her in London. She is on the point of Setting out, in order to accelerate

LETTER XXXVII.
Lady Bell to Lady Lucy.
A Strange Scheme indeed ! And are you really ’capable of carrying So abSurd a design into execution ? Can you confent to bury yourSelf alive ? I am ready to allow that your man— from your description of him—is an 4	un-
i
The Disinterested Marriage. 25
uncommon character, a ■phenomenon in the world of gallantry, a difmterefted lover: but consider, my dear Lucy, how can you^ who have been bred up with a relish for all the elegant refinements of life, bring yourSelf to be shut up in a dull, dirty, and obScure country village? How will you bear yourSelf in the vulgar chara<5ter of a country houSewife, after having figured as a woman of fashion ? Your narrow Scheme may, perhaps, be a very prudent one, but Surely it cannot be very palatable : it can only be pleasing, I imagine, to thoSe who feel themSelves inclined to laugh at you. Indeed, my dear, I never thought that you., with your excessive vivacity, and uncommon accomplishments, would d\yindle into a tame household dove, and give up every joy in life; that excepted, arising from the VoL. IL	C	Society
26 The Disinterested Marriage.
Society of only one perSon. Surely, my dear, by thus confining yourSelf to one man, you diScover a very limited taste, a much narrower mind than I thought you poffeffed.
You will be possibly offended at my ' freedom, and think, that as I am under the dominion of the tender pafsion my-Self, 1 ought to have Ipared you., merely upon Sympathetic considerations. I am not, however, preciSely in the Situation ^ you SuppoSe me to be: I have, indeed.
So far got the better of the ‘ little love lurking in my heart, v/hich was, in truth, only a plague to me, that I am now as free as air. Yet, though I do not interest mySelf Sushciently about Lord Ashbourne, to make mySelf un-eaSy on his account, I shall, nevertheless, exped him to perform his part of

the contradt between us. I would have men cured of the ridiculous propensity they have to make love to every woman they See : a propensity which has proved fatal to many-- many of our Sex. I think, therefore, that ought not only to be upon our guard against any future designs of that fort, but to do every thing in our power to punish thoSe who have already adted in So infamous a manner. I look upon a fellow of this fort as a Scandalous charadler, and unworthy of the attention cf a woman with the least degree of merit. You will imagine, no doubt, from thefe far-castical effusions, that I am out of humour with all mankind. I can assure you, however, that you are mistaken: I can even assure you tfiat I esteem your Frankland, if he is really the man he appears to be ; nor would I Say a single C 2	word

Tell me no more of being narrowminded, and upon being pent up in the corner of a dtill country village: talk

Bell, I could laugh at your ignorance ; but, to be Sure, a womans’ whom a fine young fellow has left for another handSome girl, and a woman' who is adored, and doated on by the faithfullest and fondest hushand in the world, cannot feel the farne fenSations. It is by totally mistaking the word hap-pinefs that you look at me in a light So very different to that in which you ought to behold me. You think I am in a mean and contemptible Situation, be-cauSe I have married a man who might have enjoyed all thoSe luxuries of life of which you Speak with So much Satisfaction, by being united to another woman, but a great deal younger than I am, and possessed of a large fortune ; but that C 4	situation
32 The Disinterested Marriage.
Situation is, in truth, the most amiable one to be conceived.
Felicity, my dear Bell, does not consist entirely in magnificence and parade, riches and Splendour will never give that heart-felt joy, to be enjoyed only in the Society of thoSe whom we love ; and as for the joy which Jhe feels with the man ho whom she is, of all her Sex, the dearest, who Spends every hour of his life with her, and in studying to pleafe her, is beyond expression — Frankland is that man, that hushand to me. I choSe him, at first, for the elegance of his perSon, the gracefulneSs of his manners, the brightness of his understanding, and the virtues of his heart; I have no rea-fon to repent of my choice : I have a thoufand reaSons for defending it: his reSpedful tenderneSs, his disinterested
passion,
The Disinterested Marriage.' 35
passion, his constant attachment, all combined to justify me not only in Supporting my choice, but in being proud of it.-r-What can a woman desire more ? How few women, indeed, meet with fuch companions for life! Who would not for Such a companion give up, without the least regret, many advantages, and be content with bare necessaries, rather than be tied to one lest amiable, leSs deServing, though possessed of an immenSe fortune ? IVe, however, are not only provided with all the conveniences of life, but even with many of thofe indulgences l for theforfeiture of which you pathetically pity me.—Can there be.

To fee ray C 5	Frank-

Frankland watch my every look, and motion, to find out my‘wishes before I utter them, and to gratify them as Soon as they are discovered, is a luxury not to be described.—To See him depressed, and'painfully affe^fed, if he only fancies I am not perfedlly well, or chearful; to See him ready to expire with pleafure, at feeing fne entirely Satisfied with him^ and with everything he does to make me happy; to See his hands tremble, and his eyes Iparkle with delight, his boshrn beat with rapture on my approach, thoLij^h -after a very short absence ate nbt ^ theSe -luxuries, child, not to be deferibed I are they-nor far Superior to thoSe which you hint at r to Splendid tables covered with all kinds of diSeaSes in' iriaS^ierade ; to brilliant jewels,^ Which teiglSt-make me look more' chziling dnde'ed, '-but which could not

add any lustre to my eyes, or any dimpling beauties to my cheeks ? Glaring carriages, and crowds of Servants, would only take off the attention of all who Saw them from me: they would certainly be more admired ; for Such ob-jedts always attradt the majority of star-ing Spedlators. In Such a pompous style of living, I should appear to little better advantage than the Lady in the Lobster ; and as to a great number of Servants, every body knows they are the most troubleSome appendixes to grandeur.
So far, my dear, I hope I have convinced you, that the want of the luxuries of life, or of a taste to enjoy them, are no wants with tne. I enjoy every rational pleaSure with my Frankland, and the highest of all delights in being So C 6	Sincerely,

In Continuation.
I have but just time to finish my letter, by telling you, that MiSs Plastow desired to correSpond with me when we parted, and that I expedh a letter from her every hour.

In short, Deshorough, I am So inexpressibly blest that I can Scarce find time—I am Sure I cannot find words—to deScribe the fuL neSs of my joy.—May it be but as permanent, as it is exquisite ! May but my angel be preServed from illneSs, from every kind of danger ! Oh ! it is utterly impossible for me to paint the hap-pineSs which it is in her power alone to confer upon me ! All my fear is, that I shall never, even with my most unwearied

wearied endeavours, be able to repay her for the tenderneSs she lavishes on me : the Sweet creature, however, appears to be delighted with every thing I Say or do, and cannot See a Single failing among the thouSand which I feel in mySelf, but of which I was not Sensible till I became So intimately connedt-ed with So a perfedl woman. Long had I sighed for a companion ; yet little did I ever expeCl to meet with one So every way deSirable, So infinitely beyond my fondest hopes. The greatest SatisfadSion, even tranSport, indeed, she discovers at every thing about her; though our manner-of living is So very different to that which she has ever been accustomed : she takes a real delight in the management of her domestic affairs, and thofe affairs take up no Small part of the morning: the rest of the day is dedicated

cated to walking, gardening, and drawing. The evening is filled up with conversation, reading, and muSick: not to mention a thouSand intermediate endear-rnents—In short, I can hardly get a moment to write to you. So delicioussy is every moment employed : and I must now break off to attend the dear Softener of all my cares, the dear improver of all my joys.—If you have any idea of true felicity, Deshorough, marry instantly, and whenever you do marry, may you be as Superlatively happy as

[IncloSed in the foregoing.]
I Should have Sooner Sent my congratulations to your Ladyship upon your marriage—a marriage entered into with the most auSpicious omens—had I not been exceedingly distressed by the departure of Lord Ashbourne, He has taken his final leave of your poor Lou-iSa; he has taken leave of her for ever..
I am thoroughly convinced, indeed, of the propriety of his behaviour; but I. I cannot help lamenting the necessity of it, with the most poignant concern. Had.
Lord Ashbourne and I been perSonally acquainted with each other fooner,, we might now have been as happy as we-are otherwise at preSent, and as we are likely to remain: for I really think he
loves
The Disinterested Marriage. 4S
loves me too sincerely to marry any other woman. Yet the tenderneSs and the constancy of his passion, instead of giving me any Satisfa(51;ion, only Serve to make me regret his loSs with a more hopeleSs Sorrow. I shall never forget the moment of our Separation. My Lord forgot his dignity, his rank, and every thing but his love, which Seemed to increaSe at' the very instant it ought to have been entirely given up. As for me, I was utterly incapable of conquering my own feelings, doubly pained by , observing the operations of his. I cannot find words strong enough to deScribe what I endured when he put a parchment into my hand, telling me, at the fame time, that it contained the writings belonging to my estate—“I resign it to “ you for ever,” continued he; “hoping,
“ and fervently wishing, that whenever
“ you
44 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ you diSpofe of your much more valu-“ able Self, you will meet with a man “ who has a just Scnfe of your merit, “ and who feels a pashon for you not “ leSs ardent than mine.”
In this manner he addressed himSelf to me, but he could hardly Speak his words intelligibly.
On my bursting into a stood of tears, he stopped short, just when he was going to leave me, and Said, with the most dejeded air imaginable, “ Nay, Mifs “ Plastow, if you weep, I cannot go “ from you.” He then Sat down by me, and Said So many Soothing things, that I began to find my Spirits greatly relieved. On a Sudden, recolleding the indiscretion of which I was guilty, by listening to his melodious voice, I roSe
precipi-
The Disinterested Marriage. 4g
precipitately—“ You forget, my Lord, “ that we are to part.”
“ I had, indeed, my LouiSa,” replied he; “ for mine I fee you ever “ will be; that is, I am certain you “ will never give your hand to another “ man, though I must not poffeSs So in-
estimable a blessing.”
Never, my Lord ; never,” answered I: “ never will I give my hand “ to any man'—”
“ Except meP added he, catching it eagerly to his lips.
Only think. Lady Lucy, how much this Softening behaviour increaSed my distreSs! How hard was it to drive him away from me at the moment I was most
Sensible
4si The Disinterested Marriage.
Sensible of his love ! I believe we should not have Separated at all, had not Mr. Ellis come in : he knew, I fancy, how it was; and thought that the longer we were together, the more difficult it would be for us to part. On his coming in he ashed my Lord a trifling question about the chaiSe at the door ; designedly, I SuppoSe, to remind him that it waited for him. At that time I thought Mr. Ellis’s appearance impertinent ; I am now Satisfied that he ap» peared with a very benevolent intention, to Spare us the astiidlion of another private adieu. My Lord, however, stood lingering, and looking as if he wanted to See Mr. Ellis walk away ; but he, re-gardleSs of his significant looks. Sat down, and Seemed not in the least diSpoSed to quit the room.—My Lord then, finding him immoveable, roSe, bowed to him, I	took
I
The Disinterested Marriage. 47
took my hand again, pressed it to his, fetched a deep sigh, aand hurried from me without turning his eye once towards me.
As Soon as my Lord was gone, fearful of Mr. Ellis’s Saying any thing to me, though inadvertently, to increaSe my grief, I ran up stairs, and remained in my own apartment, to indulge it, the rest of the day.—I was totally unfit for company. In the evening I received a letter from my Lord, dated from Dover, where he waited for a wind. Never was there, certainly, fuch a letter written by a man to a woman whom he was to relinquish for ever. He made a thousand apologies for writing, declaring that he was not master of himSelf—that he could not rest till he had, with his pen, taken a more tender, passionate
adieu
48 The Disinterested Marriage.
adieu than he had dared to take in per^ Son.
I Sighed, and could not—simpleton as I am—help expressing, in an anSwer, a thouSand things which I alSo could not articulate when we parted. I received an inconceivable pleaSure from the communication of my thoughts upon paper, for the first and last time.—As he was not then married, I ventured to indulge mySelf in this piece of folly, which I was the more eager to commit, not having been able to expreSs what I had felt on his refigning all his power over me— •His resignation ofit, indeed,pained me the more, as I could not bear to be deSerted by him, nor to find the man to whoSe care my father left me. So ready to give me up.—I told him, therefore, that I would return the writings (as I did not
chooSe
The Disinterested Marriage. 49
chooSe to be my own mistreSs) and continue under his protedtion, whether he was married or single as my continuance under it could not be injurious to the Lady whom he made his wife : concluding, with affuring him that I would teo nothing without his advice and approbation.
Whether he approves of what I have done, I cannot tell; but this I know, my heart is lighter since I have laid it entirely open to his inSpedlion ; for, tho’
I were certain never to See him again, I should be exceedingly miserable to have my condudl deServing of his cenSure,
No, I would study every thing which would, I think, pleaSe him, were we to meet. This will be all the conSolation I dare hope for; and with this, after having wished him every kind of feli-VoL. II.	D	city,

LETTER XLII,
Mrs. Stanlev to Mrs. Forbes.
I A M got hither at last, after having had a tolerable SeaSon at Brighthelm-stone. Sir George, though a lover of pleaSure, is not So eager in the purSuit of it as many men are who appear leSs fond of it: he is likely, however, to find amuSement which he did not in the least expedt.
One of the finest, handSomest fellows in the world is come to live here upon his own little estate.—The arrival of Such a man, you vfill Say, cannot give any great entertainment to my brother: but this elegant fellow, elegant he C in every reSpedl:, has ran away with a young woman of quality, the most ami-D 2	able
52 The Disinterested Marriage.
able creature in the univerfe, as Sir George tells me, for I have not yet Seen her, though he teaSes me to death to go and visit her. Now I have no ob-jedion at all to the hushand, but what shall I do with the wife ? One hand-fome woman is always in the way of another. Sir George, indeed, is very ready to take her off the hands of us both ; yet, by all accounts, she not only married out of pure disinterested love : she has been married above six weeks, and is not tired of her hushand : on the contrary, she rather grows fonder of him: and as for hirri.^ they Say, (for every woman in the place Sets her^cap at him) that he loves no body except his wife. Poor things! they will know better by and by, it is to be hoped. I was married near three weeks to Mr. Stanley, before I found him out, for I
was
The Disinterested Marriage. 5j
was a mere child, and monstroufiy ignorant. The moment, however, I Saw he began to grow tired, I became as weary as himSelf, and we both took our Separate pleaSures with the greatest eaSe imaginable. After all, Charlotte, theSe men are immenSely stupid; they complain of the IkentiouSneSs of the women, when they themSelves are entirely to blame. Only consider siov/ exceedingly weak it is, and foolish,for a man to marry a young creature, to be vaStly fond of her for a little time, and after that, never to trouble himSelf any more about her than if she was his grandmother. She, just come to the knowledge of her beauty, and the power naturally arising from that beauty, after having been initiated into the most pleasurable Scenes which she is capable of enjoying, is Suddenly, when her huS-D 3	band’s
54 The Disinterested Marriage.
band’s appetite is Satiated, thrown aside, never to be regarded any more with the Smallest degree of Satisfadlion by him; by the only man from whom she has reaSon to expedt happineSs; the man whom she has Sworn to love, honour, and obey. Such was my situation with Mr. Stanley, whoSe inSolence and indifference Soon made me have for him the greatest aversion and contempt. But I have no hopes of making any thing of this Frankland, So vastly is he attached to one woman, whom he, with equal justice and constancy, I must ov/n, prefers to all her Sex. By the way though, there is Something strangely gothic in their conjugal behaviour : I commend it indeed, but I think it, not-witlistanding, very awkward and unfashionable : it is not, in short, according to the ton of the times. It is a pity
that
The Disinterested Marriage. 55
that Frankland, of all men, should be So constant a creature: were his tender-neSs not So confined, were he as sickle as the majority of his Sex, his tender-neSs might be diffusive enough to make a hundred w'omen extremely happy. I have lately, I own, looked upon constancy as the certain mark of a narrow mind, and think that there is Something infinitely more noble in making our af-feDions as extensive as our acquaintance. 1 dare Say Sir George is of my opinion ; but whether wc shall ever prevail on theSe new neighbours to adopt cur Sentiments upon this Subject, is another matter, and by time only to be decided. Whenever I am able to give you farther information about it, you shall hear again from

Sir George would not let me have a moment’s peace till I went to See this I.,adyLucyFrankland; and what was still more provoking, he would go with me. I had much rather have gone by mySelf, though perhaps his company was So far of uSe, as to bring Frankland into the room to us: yet I think he hardly would have staid away from his wife So long. (What strange people ! How differently do they behave from married people in general 1) Never did I See So perfedly

lovely a man So deiperately enamoured with a woman, as he Seems to be with her; and yet she is no beauty., very far from being one; she can Scarce be called handSome. Sir George, however, —theSe men you know, Charlotte, al-v/ays See more than other folks, often fee indeed what is not to be Seen—Sir George Says she is the most beautiful creature that ever existed. She has certainly a je ne ffoi quci about her, which pleaSes even me, and that is Saying a great deal; for we fine women commonly have an aversion to each other ; and it is very natural for us- to have a mutual aversion, as there is not, I cfare believe, a single Soul among us, who would not be glad to make a conquest over all the tolerable fellows who fall in our way. Now whenever women interfere in the purSsiit of the fame de-D 5	Signs,
58 The Disinterested Marriage.
signs, they muSc of courSe hate each each other most cordially. ASter all, there is Something So insinuating. So agreeable in this Lady Lucy, that one cannot help being pleaSed with her, in Spite of one’s reaSon.
“ Tell me what she is like—how she “ looked — what she Said —^what she “ had on.”
She IS neither tall nor short; neither fair nor brown; neither fat nor lean; she is of a moderate height,of a pleasing size, and of a clear complexion. Her hair is dark, part of it is combed up, and part of it hangs careleSsly over her forehead,giving an half archneSs, an half innocent, pidlureSque air to her face, which is neither long nor round. She has an agreeable shape, and a pair of Smiling eyes, under the finest
long
The Disinterested Marriage. 59
long eye-lashes I ever beheld: her lips are red and pouting, her teeth white, but irregular; her neck, boSom and hands, are remarkably white and delicate. So much Sor her perSon. She was dressed in a white lustring nightgown ; her linen was clear mussin, with a sine Brussels point edging : she had a pink petticoat, and pink ribbons: her cap was Small, and particularly elegant, though rather too infantile for an un-dreSs : it became her, however; and a woman of taste ought only to conSult the becoming when she looks in her glaSs. This white neck was decently and gracefully covered, not with a twisted tippet, like a shein of thread, but with a sinall, well made handkerchief, which discovered and concealed beauties. Sir George Said, at the Same time: but men have unaccountable ways of expressing D 6	them-
6o The Disinterested Marriage.
themSelves : yet, to be Sure, take her all together, she is an agreeable figure, and has a manner, a* Spirit in her conversation, which forces your attention, whether you will or not. She has, indisputably, enchanted her huS-band, to whoSe perSon I deSpair of doing justice. To Say that he is tall, and genteelly formed, is to Say nothing; and it is impossible for me to deScribe the extreme gracefulneSs of his whole appearance ; his excessive eaSe, and the elegance of every particular movement—his hair—his teeth—^his eyes— there is no looking at his eyes—So brilliant are they —they Sparkle when he is- talking to any indifferent people; but the tenderest languor Swims in them when they are fixed upon her who Seems to engage all his thoughts. He is very polite indeed to every body, but fie is
at-
The Disinterested Marriage. 6i
attached, it may be truly Said, to her alone. In short, I was Soon Ikk of being considered only as the Second figure in the piece. I had never a great idea, of being the confidante of lovers, and 1 really could fee mySelf in no other light, as Lady Lucy appeared to be the only woman in the room. Her man is. quite intoxicated with love and joy, and my wiSe brother Seemed to be as much charmed as the doating hushand : he was So remarkably assiduous about her, that she blushed more than once*
I, who never want Something to Say,
. expressed my apprehensions of her wanting amuSement during the winter months, or in their dull, stupid village.— ^ He replied, “ No, Madam, Lady Lucy “ has a fimd of entertainment within “ herSelf; she is very musical, and y draws in a very fine taste.”—“ Pray,
“ my
Cl The Disinterested Marriage..
“ my dear,” added he, rising, and going up to her with a befeeching air in his charming eyes, “ oblige Mrs. Stanley “ with a fight of your bracelet.”—She Smiled conSent: he then took off her glove as gently as if he was afraid of hurting her, and unfastened a string of pearls, to which his picture hung, of her own painting. It was very prettily done; but Such a pair of eyes would almost inSpire the blind. She has kept up all the Spirit of the original, and made him even languish on her with her pencil.
Sir George was, as he is apt to be, in raptures, and Swore that it must be transporting to fit to her. I declare I thought I made a mighty silly figure, while the two men, entirely taken up
with
The Disinterested Marriage. 63
with her., did not appear to know that I was in the room.
When my brother could be prevailed on to part with his toy, Frank-land would not let Lady Lucy replace it on her arm herSelf. Sitting down by her, he was a long time fiddling about her; and pressed her arm So warmly to his bofom, that I began to think he wished us out of the way. She read what I thought, I fancy, and blushed So amazingly, that her doating hushand let her hand go, and looked as if he was fearful of having diSpleaSed her by detaining it So long. His eyes were then hardly off her a moment. He aSked her, repeatedly, if she vras well, and offered to bring another chair for her, imagining her Seat was uneaSy to her. She declined his offer in the most
obliging
64 The Disinterested Marriage.
obliging manner. Sir George indeed told me, when we came home, that the fweetneSs of her behaviour had made him wish himfelf, a thouSand times, in the possession of Such a woman. In short, Lady Lucy has turned my brother’s head, and Frankland has turned mine. As for them^ they, at preSent,. are too much wrapped up in each other, to bestow a look on us. How they may feel, before the winter is half over, I cannot tellthey may, by that time, begin to wish that they had Some tolcr rable neighbours. I am already almost, moped to death. Sir George frequently throws himSelf acroSs a couple of chairs,, and sighs out “ Divine Lucy,” a hundred times a day. To conclude : theSe disinterested lovers, as they are called by people who know Something of their story, torment m.e exceedingly; and if

The quiet conversation of the redtor now and then, and the Sober, civil chat of his wife, with a few How d’ees given and returned by Some of the best fort of farmers and their families,, and questions^ about corn and cattle, at market, are quite Sufficient for us rusticks. People of fashion and taste are, by no means,., proper companions for us; they are, indeed, the only people we would avoid ; but I fee it: is impossible : the Gentleman and the Lady are, both, likely to be exceedingly troubleSome.

However, they are perpetually coming after us ; and by So doing very much interrupt, very much disturb us: it is really quite diSagreeable to my deareft girl, who is not in a situation to bear fatigue. We have acquainted them with our design to live in the most private manner; but Sir George thinks that a parti quarree is more eligible for us than a tete a tete; and as to Mrs. Stanley, Jhe cannot endure retirement at all.—We laugh, ourSelves, at our unfashionable taste, and look grave at thoSe who would rally us out of it; but all to no purpoSe : they will not let us enjoy ourSelves in our own way: we love walking; when my dear Lucy is weary, I take her up in my Italian chair, which one horSe will draw with Sufficient velocity ; but as Sir George thinks no carriage

He fends us fruit, game, and noSegays which are uncommonly elegant for the leaSon ; but we had rather not be under any obligations to him.

rustic Charles to all the pretty fellows in the univerSe. It has ever been my opinion, that a man stands a far greater chance of being plagued than pleaSed by his neighbours; and therefore it is best to have no connexion with them. —My Lucy wants my assistance—I will conclude by and by.
In Continuation.
It was not my wiSe to whom I was called : she, it Seems was just gone to visit a poor cottager, at a little distance, who lies in with twins, and to whom her purSe, as well as Sympathising heart, has been for Some time open. When I came into the parlour, I found Mrs. Stanley, reclined on the Sofa, in the most inviting attitude you can imagine,
with

with her head Supported by her hand, and one foot dangling over the other ; both of which were Slightly covered with the -prettiest pair of flippers to be conceived. Her neck, really very white, and well turned, was half-concealed, half-expoSed to my observation, by the negligent air with which the handkerchief designed for it was thrown aside. Instead of rising at my entrance, as I naturally fuppoSed site would, she only just lifted up her eyes with a languishing Smile, and Said, “ Lord, Mr. Frankland, “ I wanted to See Lady Lucy—As the “ horSes were not put'to the chaiSe, I “ attempted to walk : shut, though it “ is a little way, you cannot imagine how much I am tired : I am really “ Scarce able to move : and ail this fa-“ tigue now is to no purpoSe, as my y Lady is not at home, I find.”
4	Such
' *
The Disinterested Marriage. 71
Such attitudes. Such glances, and Such an addreSs, required a Suitable an-Swer; but I am become perfeftly dead to every thing in petticoats, my wife excepted. I therefore told her that Lady Lucy was gone out for the afternoon, and had not the gallantry to desire her to stay to keep me company. She was indeed almost neceshtated to take her leave, as I did not once sit down, though her eyes, and every part of her behaviour, strongly invited me, but '-stood as if I wished her, impatiently, to retreat.
Finding she could make nothing of me, she roSe, at last, yet roSe very feebly, as if she was lame, stretching out her hand, at the Same time, to catch at Something for her Support: yet my hand
offered

offered not to give her the least assistance.
“ Lord bleSs me ! ’’ cried she, letting: herfelf fall again on the Sofa, “ I do not “ think it possible for me to walk ; and “ yet I mufi return—Will you be So “ obliging. Sir,” added she, “ with a look and tone, which were, I dare Say, in her opinion, irreSistible, “ will you be “ So obliging as to See me Safe back ? “ I brought no Servant with me, and I “ am really afraid I shall not be able to go by mySelf.”
Still I made no reply. I stood in a posture of taking leave, ready to return to my grounds, where I expeded to meet my Lucy, v/ho went out at the garden door. I was quite mistaken, however; she was determined to make
me

me attend her, whether I would or not; for getting up a Second time, she caught hold of me, and Said, “ I am Sorry to “ be So troubleSome, Mr. Frankland ; “ but indeed I cannot walk without “ leaning on Somebody.’*
Still I hung back, telling her that it would be better for her to Send for her chariot, though I dreaded the delay which the Sending for it would occasion: but my Scheme was unSucceSsful: there was no shaking her off: she clung as cloSe as if I had Saved her from drowning; and I was, at length, forced to accompany her, merely to get rid of her.
Thus you See how exceedingly impertinent the politest people, the best neighbours, may be.

There are Some people indeed who will not be kept at a distance ; Sir George is a man of this cast. I should not, however, mind his encroachments, were I not afraid that my dear Charles should be drawn into a quarrel on my account. When I think of that^ I adlually tremble, and about So foolish an affair too. Having been to give a little advice, and a little money, to a poor tenant, who rents a cottage at the back of our ground, I met, on my return home. Sir George. He told me he had been waiting for my coming out, from the time he Saw me go in. I replied, that he had
\
given himSelf a great deal of unnecessary trouble; adding, that I did not know he could have any busineSs with me.— “ The Same busineSs,” an-fwered he, “ which all who See you “ have—to admire you.” Then, throw-4	ing

ino; his arm round me, he began to take Some very unbecoming freedoms.
I broke from him immediately, and was hurrying home as fast as possible : he Seized my hand, and putting it under his arm, Squeezed it cloSely ; declaring,-at the Same time, that he would take care of me, and carry me in his arms, ' rather than Suffer me to walk too far.— Provoked at this excessive familiarity, I pulled my hand away with violence, and told him I did not understand Such behaviour ; but he st’ore I should not leave ' him in anger, riming into a conversation not at all fit for my hearing ; a conversation which would have been highly disagreeable to me, had not my heart been immoveably fixed. I was now' quite angry with him : I struggled, and, at length, diSengaged mySelf from him ; but he, fomehov/, contrived to kiSs me E 3	before

before I could entirely shake him off.
His last impertinence rouSed my indignation to Such a degree, that I hardly knew what I Said to him. I only know I came home So very much diSconcerted, that my dear Frankland was quite a-larmed at my appearance : he has been anxious about me ever since : he is, indeed, the kindest, best of men: I '' always thought I should be happy with him, but never could have conceived the felicity which I enjoy. I have entirely brought Mrs. Selby to approve of my marriage, though she was at first extremely averSe to it. She informs me that my coufin Harry Mend is perfectly recovered, and that he is going to be married to a Lady who has been Some time at Montpelier with her father, whom she accompanied for the restoration of his health. I Sincerely wish that

To dell' you the truth, Mrs. Bowen, the ReDor’s wife, who Seems to be the best Sort of woman in the world, is infinitely Serviceable to me with her knowledge. She has taught me how to cut out and make every thing necessary for the approaching occasion, which employs me very agreeably. While I am So employed, Mr. Frankland reads to me, plays to me, or sings to me : Sometimes too he makes sscetches of me, in the various attitudes in which he finds me, when he returns from looking after his men

I Have been very much out of order, my dear Bell, or you would have heard of me before; and my mind has been still more indilpoSed than my body, I have been very miserable indeed. Some officious perSon, fancying that we cannot be happy becauSe we are not rich, has taken it into his head to offer my Charles a place; but it is Such a place that the acceptance of it will make me.
wretched.
88 The Disinterested Marriage^
wretched. He is pressed to oo to the West Indies, and without me too. Can I hear of Such a Separation ? can I hear oS it without being distradSed ? Certainly not: I had rather live in the most frugal manner, I had rather be deprived not only of the pleaSures of life, but of many of the conveniences, whicih we at present enjoy~~and may continue to enjoy with Qcconomy—than be Separated from my Charles. To what purpoSe should I wish to change my situation ? I declare I cannot conSent to it. I would rather die than be Separated from my Frankland, or See him on my account— for he had a genteel Sufficiency when I married him^—driven from his native land ; from his own Small, yet well cultivated, paternal estate, to a clime which must, undoubtedly, be very diSagree-able to him—and very pernicious too—
not
The Disinterested Marriage. S9
not to mention the state of odious de- » pendance in which he must necessarily live. I shudder at the thoughts of it, and have, by the earnestnefs of my intreaties, prevailed on him to refufe an offer which, but for my fake, for the fake of rendering my Situation more af-fiuent, he never would have thought of accepting. He is the kindest, the most indulgent of men, and, till this talk of a Separation, never has occasioned me a moment’s uneasineSs.
I have been a good deal perSecuted by this impertinent Sir George : and I Suffer the more from his impertinence, as I am obliged to conceal it from my Frankland, lest he should—as I am certain he would—corredt him. He hardly lets me have a minute’s rest: he follows me every where; he pesters me

with preSents ; he is continually fending me notes and compliments, of which I take not any notice : and yet he will not desist. From this quarter, I imagine, the offer of the place comes; as he thinks that I cannot venture upon Such a voyage, and that Mr. Frankland must leave England as Soon as he accepts of his West Indian appointment. I hope, however, that he never will, on any account listen to it. Yet I cannot help being apprehensive that a mistaken tenw derneSs for me may prompt him to take a step for the, fuppofed, increafe of my happineSs, which will render us both very miSerable, I have been quite negligent of all my correspondents; I cannot, therefore, be SurpriSed at not hearing So frequently from Mils Plastovv.

The buSineSs designed for me ,was to colledl duties, which are ever paid with reludance, beca.ufe they distreSs the indigent, and grind the industrious.

pression upon them. I never yet met with a man totally inSensible to a fine woman’s advances, though he had a handSome mistreSs or wife of his own. Most men like a little change. Variety is the very Soul of pleaSure : but this Frankland is So entirely attached to his wife, who is fit only to go tame about the houSe, and breed, that there is no drawing him from her. I have gone as far as I well could, without absolutely exposing mySelf: he is inSensible to me; yet he by no means wants either understanding or penetration, and I do not care to be an objeft of contempt and ridicule to a man who, in Spite of his negledt, commands esteem and reSpedt from every woman. Such a man cannot be impoSed upon : he fees through all our arts, and reads our very Souls. Such ' a man may Sometimes be lured, but

never can be driven to any thing. This Frankland—What a provoking devil! — is capable of resisting every temptation. My brother, who is in love with Lady Lucy to madneSs, I think, made uSe of all his interest to procure a place for her hushand in the West Indks, on pur-poSe to Send him out of the way, in ' order to fee what effedt his abSence would have on her; but he, at once,. refuSed an employment which would •have Sent him to a distance from her.

declined it. He will not accept of either of the appointments promiSed ; there	!
is, consequently, no hope of making apy thing of him : I shall not, therefore, condeScend to trouble mySelf any farther about him.—Sir George, I believe, will not give up Lady Lucy So easily he adiually raves about her, and declares, he never beheld a woman So exquisitely pleasing. I cannot, certainly, be of his opinion; but men are strange judges of beauty. However, he will not find himSelf SucceSsful with her. He may Sancy himSelf as handSome as Frankland, but he is vastly mistaken; they are not to be mentioned at the Same, time; it would be the idlest thing in the world to make a comparison between them.

I did not fay a Single word against his long abSence; I Smiled, and Spoke So civilly to him, that he Seemed at a loSs to. diScover what I meant. He bowed, and sighed; opened his mouth to Speak, and shut it immediately without Speaking. It was not my bufineSs, you know, to ash questions ; by So doing I should have discovered a weakneSs of which, I hope, I never shall be guilty.

However, as /pints converfe Sometimes (you know) I began to think he might entertain me, at least, by telling me what I wanted to hear, if he could fay nothing more a-greeable.
One morning, when we were in a yawning tete a tete, I Said to him—* “ Yotir Lordship has been returned “ above ten days, 1 believe, without “ mentioning a word about MiSs Pla-“ stow.”

“ Umph—” anSwered I, with a Spiteful air ; Surely she must have a vast.

She is, certainly, not only the most charming of women, but the best of wives, and will be a pattern for mothers. Few women, blest with the most affiuent fortunes, and married even beyond their expedlations,. are contented with their Situations ; they are still aiming to eclipSe Some friend or acquaintance, in dreSi, equipage, or entertainments.

Our friends, indeed, both male and female, when they found that we were not likely to increaSe our fortunes by our marriage, and that we should not keep open houSe for them, deSerted us all at once, and I can truly Say that we have lost all our acquaintance, except your-felf. My wife, indeed, corresponds with Lady Bell Wallace, and MiSs Pla-stow ; but I much question whether the former, on her return to England, will eondeScend to look upon us.

I HAVE not been deceived in you, dearLady Lucy, since I imputed your long silence to the right cauSe, and now give your Ladyship and Mr. Frankland joy on the birth of your Son,

I will own, however, that it gave me great pleaSure: yet, as it is a pleaSure I ought not to reckon upon, I am afraid to indulge it. It is really a charming letter: there is So much good SenSe, and So much tenderneSs in it, that I could dwell upon it for ever. He
tells

tells me that his heart frequently revolts against a step that at first appeared to him perfeDly right, though it cost him an infinite deal of pain to comply wsith it: he tells me he now repents Sincerely of that step, and is every hour more convinced of the impropriety, of the injustice indeed, of his conduct. He adds, “ It is impossible for me any longer to “ Support a charadler foreign to my “ heart: I will lay open that heart to “ Lady Bell, and diSdoSe • my fen-“ timents for you; at the fame “ time I will declare my readineSs to “ perform my engagements to hf>rt “ Lady Bell therefore will be loon “ intorrned of the true state of the “ cafe, know how to a£t in a situation “ the most delicate, perhaps, in feniale' “ life.

What a transporting conclusion of his letter! — But I am afraid to See him in the situation he wishes to appear before me.
Tell me now. Lady Lucy, is there any thing So very extravagant in what Lord Ashbourne has propoSed ? Would he not aft very unlike a man of honour, by pretending to love one wDman, when his whole Soul is devoted to another ? Lady Bell Wallace Surely cannot be shappy with a man who freely

Yesterday a very genteel post-chaiSe and four drove up to our door. Such an equipage, Deshorough, does not often appear before our humble habitation. Out jumped as genteel a young fellow as I have Seen for Some time. He introduced himSelf by Saying, that though he had not the honour of being personally acquainted with me, he was happy in being known to Lady Lucy. After having made a polite enquiry after her health, and her little Son’s, he added, that his name was Fanshaw; that he was a near neighbour of Mrs. Selby’s; and that he had promiSed her to pay his reSpefts to Lady Lucy and me in his way to London, being on the point of Setting out for Paris; to which place he should be very ready to carry any of her Ladyship’s commands, or mine.

I recolletSted immediately that this must be the very man of whom I had been So apprehensive before my dearest girl would conSent to be united to me by the strongest ties: and as he again af-fured me that he was in haste to leave England, I readily condudted him to my wife. He behaved to her with a re-Spedtful kind of friendship which could not but be very pleasing. He caressed my boy more'than once, wished that he -was his; and added, that, in order to bring him as near him as possible, he should be extremely glad to be his godfather: he then produced adetter from Mrs. Selby, wherein she communicated to Lady Lucy her design to be his godmother.

I am quite pleaSed that it is in my power to refuSe Sir George, without making Mr. Bowen uneaSy, who will now perform the ceremony instead of his curate. I could have aSked Harry Swymmer; but though both he and his Sister appeared willing to forward my union with Lady Lucy, they have not •since behaved in the most agreeable manner; they are, both of them, too much attached to the world, and all its parade and nonfenSe, not to think that Lady Lucy and I might have been much happier, might have aded, at least, much wiSer, by giving up, what

“ for Some time, Lady Edl, ever since “ my return, indeed, wished to open “ my heart to you : but shame, fear—
“ and a number of contending passions,

Lady Lucy, could have heard Such a declaration against themSelves, with more compoSure than I did Lord Ashbourne’s free effujions. ReSolving, indeed, to put the best face 1 could upon the matter, I, with a Sort of a forced

He looked at me as if he did not, or would not, understand me; and, by this time, I thought I had been rather too flippant. I really began to feel for him, and thought his situation was an uncommonly awkward one. I, therefore, treated him with the utmost frank-neSs; told him, that I had for Some time known his inclination for MiSs Plastow, and had only waited for the intelligence from himSelf; adding, that T had alSo heard she was very amiable, and that I Sincerely wished him happy with her.
This change in my behaviour produced an instantaneous one in his Lord-Sliip. He Seized my hand with almost as much tranSport as if it had been his LouiSa’s, called me generous, noble creature, and begged I would grant him, VoL. II.	H	if

if I could ever restore him to my good opinion, my'friendship; which it should be his perpetual study to deServe.
I told him,I would, provided he. In return, would procure me the friendship of the Lady in question.
I ashed nothing more of him: he promised to comply with my request, faying, that MiSs Piastow had too much SenSe, too much discernment, to refuSe me. He will now, I SuppoSe, make all possible haste to England, in order to complete the happineSs of the lovely Plastovv.

I CANNOT sit down to write to you, without repeating my own thanks and Lady Lucy’s, for your kind-i neSs in being godfather to my little Charles. 1 could absolutely make my-Self ridiculous, by expatiating in the pretty fellow’s praiSe. I will check my paternal effusions, however ; I will keep them under till you become a parent yourScif—then laugh at me if you can.
I have been a good deal vexed since you left us—Maria, whom I took to be quite a little innocent, has turned out an arrant gipSey. She was placed at the ParSonage, it Seems, on purpoSe to
draw

draw me from my Lucy. I thought indeed, at first sight of her, that she had Something about her which did not thoroughly accord with the affedted simplicity of her behaviour : young however, pleasing to an uncommon degree, and eager to render herSelf engaging, she allures the eye, and fixes the attention, before you can be aware of the miSchief she may do you. Fortunately, 1 found her out time enough to be upon my guard: I always fancied she was particularly buSy about, me: I would not willingly indulge a cenSurable vanity ; but she really appeared to be entirely indiScreet; more So, at least, than any girl of charadler ought to be : yet I confeSs I was taken in by her affedled naivete., and mistook all her art for na-^ tore. She was ever very assiduous to pleaSe me before Lady Lucy’s consine-H 3	ment;

ment; when she was Safe in her bed, she then began to shew herfelf, but in a gradual manner.—Now, as the trying of a fine girl naturally attraDs the attention cf the most inSenfible man, 1 own I was Sometimes tempted to trifle with her again, though I adtually meant to do So most innocently : she drew me on, however, by permitting me to take one liberty after another, till 1 became almost intoxicated with the pleasing folly. I forgot every thing, except my dear, my ever-loved Lucy : I never lost fight of her-, fr}6 was ever preSent to iny imagination: her image roSe to my m.ind in all the dignity of virtuous tenderneSs, when I was most in danger from this Seducing girl. — While she hung over me one day, in the playfullest attitude imaginable, one hand being thrown acroSs my shoulder, the other
wantonly
The Disinterested Marriage. 151
wantonly employedj, in turning a ringlet of my hair, I started up, and pushed her hastily from me, just when her lips were ready to m.eet mine. I hope I should have had as much fortitude, if my heart had not been unalterably attached to my wife. I should, at any time,
' have deSpiSed mySelf for taking an improper advantage of uingvi^rdeci innocence.—My fuppofed innocent companion, on my pushing her from me, walked away immediately, without mov-her head towards me, .and hurried out ^ of the room. I then determined to. shun her very carefully for the future.—I did So ; I kept from Mrs, Bowen’s, for fe-veral days ; but as she) frequently called upon my wife, I could not avoid feeing her.—I behaved to her, however, with - great reSdrve: at first!-.she affedted not to perceive the change, in my carriage,

and renewed her former familiarities ^ Vet finding they would not do, she grew Serious; dcjeded indeed, though her visits to me were more frequent. Still I took no other notice of her than what common civility required.
My Lucy now quitted her apartment, and fat in the parlour as uSual. MiSs Waters came and brought her Vviork.
Having been at play one morning with my boy, Maria, who Sat looking at us, attempted to attradl my attention, by caressing the child : but as I choSe to let her See that I would not encourage any farther freedoms, I gave my boy to his mother, took my hat, and walked into the garden. She followed me instantly. I let her See that I wished to avoid her, but she purSued
me. ,

me. When I came to the part of my grounds from which, you know, there is an opening to the meadows, I went out at the door, and was going to lock ' it after me, in order to Secure my retreat. — “Hold, Sir,” cried she, stopping me, with great agitation, “hear me a “ moment: it will be the last time I “ shall e\^er trouble you; but I cannot “ bear to leave you, while you harbour a bad opinion of me, though I am “ in Some shape deServing of cenSure.
“ I have been put upon adling a part,” added she, with a voice Softened by her tears, and' still more agitated, “for “ which I now condemn mySelfj as I “ am convinced of the folly,, of the “ baSeneSs of it; yet I hope you will “ pardon me, and not think amiSs of “ me, Mr. Frankland, when I tell you,

Sit down for one quarter “ of an hour, and listen to a poor un-“ fortunate girl, whom your exemplary ^	“ condud will Save from additional in-
“ Sarny—who is doomed, however, to “ Suffer for her past errors.’*
\
I was astonished at this strange, unexpected preamble—I will not pretend, indeed, to tell you I had not, for Some time, believed that Maria looked on me with very favourable eyes ; but I was, I own, amazed to hear her So freely declare her passion for me : for me, a married man, and particularly attached to my wife. Astonished, however, as I
was.

was, I complied with her request, tho* I am Sensible that I looked wonder. She began in the following manner;
« When you first Saw me at Mr. “ Bowen’s, Sir, you believed me to be “ what I once was, an innocent country “ girl: would to heaven I had always “ remained So ! My father is a farmer “ in LeicesterSnire, a tenant of Sir “ George CaSwell’s. In taking a view “ one day of his estate in that county, “ he, unfortunately for me. Saw me, “ and took a fancy to me. I was “ then very young (I am now but Seven-‘‘ teen) and had Seen very little of the “ world. I will however confeSs, that “ though I was flattered by his fine “ Speeches, I felt no particular incli-“ nation for him. I did not at that time know what love meant; I only H 6	“ wi filed
156 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ wished to be admired and caressed “ more than my companions. Sir George “ decoyed me from home upon a party “ of pleaSure, and prevailed on me to “ drink a quantity of warm liquor af-“ ter dancing. There was certainly “ Something infuSed into It; for my “ ideas were Soon in a disordered state, “ and, in conSequence of that state, I “ was totally in the power of my Se-“ ducer. When I first discovered my “ unhappy* Situation, I raved, wept, “ and thought mySelf the most miSera-“ ble of human beings; but my un-“ doer found a way to Soothe and to “ calm me, by preScnts, and by a ten-“ derneSs, which, had it continued, “ would have made me more Satisfied “ wsith my condition, though it never “ could have reconciled me to my fate; ‘‘ nor should I at first have listened to
“ him.
The Disinterested Marriage. 157
“ him, had I not been afraid to go “ home to my father.—Refiedling, co-“ vered with shame, on what, was past, “ and dreading ill. treatment at home “ after my criminal proceeding, I con-“ fented to live with Sir George in the “ manner he desired; that is, in the “ most retired manner, in a Small village “ within a few miles of London. There “ 1 was gradually neglefted by him;
but he furnished me with money “ enough for a genteel Subsistence, in “ a private way. In. that way indeed “ I was far from being happy, and my “ recolledions were Sufficiently painful “ to render me leSs So : yet I was afraid “ 10 quarrel with my Supporter, lest he “ should v/ithdraw his allowance. At “ last, however, I told him plainly, that “ I was tired of my Situation, and that “ I imagined he would be glad to get
“ rid
158 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ rid of me; adding, that he might “ easily do So, if he would only con-“ Sent to fettle on me, for my life, a “ quarter of what he at that tiirie al-“ lowed me: assuring him alfo, that I “ would go down into Leicestershire, “ and never trouble him again.
“ He made me no reply for Some “ moments — After a long pauSe, he “ Said — I will consider of it. — I “ Saw no more' of him for a fort-“ night—He then returned, and in-“ formed me that he would agree to “ what I had requested, upon one condi-“ tion.
“ I begged earnestly to hear what I “ was required to do for the purchaie “ of a competency ; but could not help “ lamenting, at the Same time, the loSs “ of my innocence.
You
The Disinterested Marriage. 159
You are a little Simpleton, Said “ he—you may be as innocent as ever “ if you pleaSe—you must affume .the “ charadler in which you first appeared “ to me, as 1 want you to draw, by “ your simplicity and apparent artleff-“ neSs, a married man from one of the “ most winning women in the world,
“ I sighed, and told him that I was “ totally unfit for fuch a talk.
“ I must give you up then. Said he;' “ for you have long been a burden to “ me. You cannot expedl to be fup-“ ported for nothing.
“ I Sighed again, wept, and intreated “ Sir George to pity me, and to Spare “ me So hard an undertaking, which nei-“ thcr Suited my capacity nor principles; “ but he only ridiculed me, and told me
“ I had
i6o The Disinterested Marriage.
“ I had learnt a great deal'of unneceffary “ refinement since I had left the farm. It “ was to no purpofe that I affured him I had-learnt every thing bad of him.^ as I “ knew no harm before I knew him ; he “ would hear of nothing but my imme-“ estate compliance with his design ; and “ threatened to reduce me immediately to “ miSery and want, if 1 persisted in a re-“ fuSal.—It is needleSs to Say that I con-“ Sented fo his new desires. Placing me “ as a ward of his with Mrs. Bowen, she, “ at Df request, introduced me x.oyou and “ Lady Lucy. The first appearance of “ your charming figure struck me; but “ when I became more acquainted with “ your manners, when I heard you play, “ sing, and converSe, my fenSes were all “ enchanted ; I forgot the reSolution I had made never to enter again into a “ criminal connexion.

“ with the delightful SenSation ariSingfrom “ the endeavours to pleaSe — flattering “ mySelf alSo, that my endeavours pro-“ miSed SucceSs, till the day you threw me “ from you with diSdain ; with a diSdain “ which pierced my Soul. — I hoped, at “ first, I had been deceived: I hoped ' “ that Some instantaneouschangeof man-“ ner. Some Sudden indiSposition had “ Seized you, and that you would be gen-“ tie and kind to me again: but when I Saw “ that you shunned me, that you was re-u Served, and offended, I thought I could not bear it any longer : 1 could not “ Support the idea of your hating me r and when I found I could not lure “ you back to the tenderneSs with “ which you had treated me, 1 wished “ to discover all : I determined to make “ an attempt to gain your esteem ; “ hoping to move your pity, at least, if “ unable to obtain your love.—I cannot,
indeed,

“ indeed, without being guilty of a cri-“ minal inclination, wish for yo,ur love; “ I must, therefore, learn not to wish for “ it: but I cannot—(continued she, lift-“ ing up her eyes with a timid SoftneSs “ in them)—I cannot take leave of you, “ Sir, for ever, without begging you to “ pardon a poor girl for being only too I “ readily charmed with your fine perSon, “ and accomplishments; for being capti-“ vated with that engaging behaviour “ which must, necessarily, affed the most “ inSenSible, without begging you alSo_ to “ conceal from Sir George all that I have “ related : he will shon See (added she, “ with a sigh) that I could not Succeed ; “ and I will leave him., I will leave this “ place for ever, whether he is generous “ enough to provide for me or not: but “ I could not think of removing mySelf “ from him till 1 had, in Some meaSure,
“ tried
The Disinterested Marriage. 163
“ tried to atone for my folly by making “ theSe confessions and intreaties.”
Here Maria cloSed her little narrative —I was struck with a behaviour So uncommon ; perhaps I was flattered by the compliments she paid me. Where is the man proof against the insinuating wiles of the insinuating Sex To Speak the honest truth, I was not at all Satisfied at finding mySelf So pleaSed with this. artful girl’s confession ; and yet my indignation against Sir George Soon got the better of every other emotion. I told her that I should think no more of what was past—I meant her part of it—j-but she mistook my meaning, I believe, and imagined that I should reSent Sir George’s behaviour; for she requested me, in the most pathetic terms, not to endanger my valuable life (as she called
it)

, k) — “I shall then,” added she, “ think “■ I have, by making this diScovery,, “ been guilty of a greater crime than I “ have yet committed.” She almost melted me by the tenderneSs of her fears, and the extreme delicacy with which she expressed them-— “ If you pay no regard “ to your own SaSety, Mr. Frankland,” Said she, “ yet for Lady Lucy’s Sake “ preServe a life So deServedly dear to “ her : Such a charatster as Sir George’s “ is unworthy of your attention. He “ may try to injure,, but he never cm “ injure Such a mind as her Lady-“ ship’s.” — She talked, in short. So • finely. So feelingly, that I began to think it quite necessary for us to Separate— I roSe, therefore, to go— She then in-treated me to let her out at the little gate, that she might return to Mrs. Bowen over the meadows. She quitted
me
The Disinterested Marriage. 165
me with tears in her eyes, and I went .stowly towards the houSe.
On my return, I found my Lucy sitting in the parlour where I had left her: she looked, I imagined, unuSually Serious. My head too was full of what I had just heard. Taking her in my arms with a tenderneSs which I had not till tliat moment experienced, and pressing her lips to my face, I thought I felt a pearly drop upon her cheek.
“ What’s the matter with my life Said I, looking anxioussy at her.
Nothing, my dear Mr. Frank-“ land,” replied she, with the Sweetest Smile; “ nothing but an extraordinary “ stow of affedion.”
“ Give
i66 The Disinterested Marriage.
“ Give it vent then, my angel,” Said I, pressing her still cloSer; my heart was full: I feared that I had, only by trifling with Maria, injured the best of creatures. I felt an indignation against the former, notwithstanding her pretended infatuation for me, which I could Scarcely SuppreSs ; and 1 determined, one day, to make my wife acquainted with every thing. Just at that time, however, I fancied I should Soften her too much. There was a tender kind of dejeistion in her countenance, which filled me with great anxiety of which I never had been before Sensible. At times I could not help fancying that my anxiety was owing to my remorSe, for having trifled with this poor, unfortunate, weak girl: I really pity her, but I wish I had never Seen her. How much has Sir George to anSwer for, by having Seduced
The Disinterested Marriage. 167
duced her from her duty to her family, ^ to the world, and to herSelf! No man,
I think, can be vindicated, who decoys an ignorant, innocent young creature from the peaceful situation, the happy Situation in which providence had placed her.—Had she not been deluded by him, she might have lived the darling of her parents, the delight of her friends, and the exemplary companion of her young female neighbours and acquaintance.
, / What a cruel change has an abandoned libertine produced in the mind of this pitiable girl! how has he perverted her principles ! how has he corrupted her manners ! When he had, by the baSest of all methods, deprived her of her SenSes, he effectually excluded all resistance ; and when her perSon was once polluted, her mind was Soon in a condition to receive any impreshon her Seducer

choSe to fix upon it. The wonder is, that as Sir George kept her continually ^employed in an infamous manner, she ever recovered her former principles, and had reSolution enough. Smote by repentance, not only to struggle with her contending passions, but to extricate herSelf from a state of life which would have certainly grown leSs and leSs tolerable had she remained in it.—Flatteringly, would she have made me believe that I was the cauSe of her reformation, by treating her with a reServe and a contempt which opened her eyes, and made her See things in their proper colours. Happy shall I think mySelf, if I have been instrumental to her return to the humble situation from which she was drawn in a manner hardly to be forgiven : at the Same time, however, I I wish I had never trifled with her, as 4	~
The Disinterested Marriage. 169
my heart reproaches me for my fooleries, on her account, as well as on my wiSe’s. I ought not to have given the fiightest encouragement to Maria; I should not have' ventured to riSque my Lucy’s feeling a single moment’s uncasineSs, though I aftually think that my dear Lucy has too much confidence in me, to have the Smallest Sulpicions concerning my fidelity to her: she has too much nobleneSs of mind to be jealous of the man she has blest with her good opinion. Doubly blameable, therefore, should I be to deceive her. How I hate mySelf for mv folly! but it is now at an end: yet I ha^oe aclcd a foolish part, and I mufi re-flesh on that part with Sorrow. What weak, imperfesh creatures we are !— Well may I pardon MiSs Waters, circumstanced as /he was, when I m.ySelf, united to Such a wife as Lucy, could VoL. II,	I	not

-Sincerely yours,
C. Frankland.
P. S. Lady Lucy told me, when I had been in Some time, that Sir George had made her a visit while I was in the garden. I replied, that I was glad I did not meet with him. She required no explanation of that anSwer, and I Said no more about it.

LETTER LIX.
Sir George Caswell to Mr. Brander.
I Have been the most unlucky fellow in the world in my attack upon Lady Lucy, who has increaSed my passion for her by an uncommon resistance, and by Sentiments, if not new, rarely to be met with: Sentiments, indeed, So great— though at the Same time So mortiSying— that I can hardly believe them to be real.
-1 told you of the plot I had laid for her, by placing Maria Waters at the Rector’s, in hopes of detaching Frank-land from his wife, whom I hoped to inSpire with reSentment, and to aid and assist in the gratification of it, and So I 2	forth—
\
172 The Disinterested Marriage.
forth—-Maria, you know, is a pretty, little toad -: she was the most artleSs of her Sex when I first took her: but where is the woman who is long either innocent or ignorant ? They Say we Spoil them; but Some are certainly ready Spoiled to our hands. The following account of my late disappointment will Serve to give strength to this affertiom Having charged Maria to take every opportunity of being with Frankland, I choSe to allow her time before I appeared mySelf, that Lady Lucy might not SuSpedt any connexion between us. As luck would have it, when I came to Frankland he was not within : his charming wife was Sitting in the parlour, employed with her needle. She hardly vouchsafed to rife at my entrance, but looked at me with the coolest indifference : that indifference provoked me, 4	perhaps,
The Disinterested Marriage, lyg
perhaps, to Say more than I otherwise should have Said. When I had complimented her upon her recovery, L told her I was Sorry to See her occupied in a manner So unSuitable to her birth and
education.
.
“ My birth. Sir,” replied she, with a charming Spirit, “ ought not . to Set. “ me above my condition ; and every “ woman’s education ought to make her “ a uSeful wife and mother.”
“ What home-bred notions are theSe, “ Lady Lucy,” Said I, “ for a woman “ with your perSon, taste, and accom-“ plishments, to entertain !—--But grant-“ ing that they are laudable in fome “ wives, they are abSurd in you ; as “ every charm, and every virtue you I 3	“ ever
174 "The Disinterested Marriage,
“ ever poffelfed, are thrown away upon a man who is unv>?orthy of you.”
A glow of indignation flushed her cheek.
“ I will hear no refledtions on Mr.
✓
“ Frankland, Sir,” anSwered she, riS-ing, to leave the room.
“ Hold, Madam,” Said I—“ stay a Single moment—Whatever unjust ideas you may have formed of me, I do not, “ at preSent, merit them. I will ven-“ ture my life on what I ami now going “ to tell you : The man for w'hom you have degraded yourSelf, for whom “ you, So condescendingly, perform of-“ Sices for Vvshich you never were dcsign-“ ed, is falSe ; falSe, Madam, to your “ beauty, and to your deferts: he is
“ fondly
✓
The Disinterested Marriage. 175
“ fondly attached to a girl So every way “■ inferior to you, that I really wonder “ at your patience: eSpecially as you “ are adored by thoSe who have the “ highest SenSe of your uncommon at-“ tradions.”
“ I receive no pleaSure,” replied she, with a kind of Sullen countenance at what I had told her, notwithstanding her affeded unconcern ; “ I receive no “ pleaSure from any perSon’s flatteries r “ my only wish is, to deServe Mr. Frank-“ land’s affefiionsP
, She then added, after a pauSe, as if recolleding herSelf, “ And I doubt not “ but that I shall always Secure his “ ejleemP
9	\
I 4	^	«You
lysi The Disinterested Marriage,
“ You must always Secure the esteem of the whole world,” anfwered I; “ nobody but a brute, destitute of Sen-“ sibility, can refufe you his esteem: “ yet it is an indisputable fadl, that Mr. “ Frankland prefers MiSs Waters to “ your Ladyship : he is, I believe, with “ her at this very moment.”
I Spoke at random, but I adlually thought that I guessed right; for she blushed, and hung her head a little while ; then, raising it on a Sudden, she Said, “ You may be very right. Sir : “ Mr. Frankland is So extremely agree-“ able, that I must not expedt to keep “ him to mySelf: but this I am Sure of, “ he whli never treat me unkindly ; or, “ fitould he treat me So, I shall still pre-“ fer him to any other man in the “ world.”
'	With
The Disinterested Marriage. 177
With theSe words she hurried out of the room : and all my efforts to lure her back again were unSucceSsful.
Finding that she would not return, I went away, exceedingly hurt at not having been able to make the Oightest impression upon her in my favour. She is really the-most extraordinary charadler I am acquainted with; few women, either wives or mistreffes, who attach them-Selves So constantly to a man; to a man who does not love them in return : Lady Lucy is, indeed, of a most amiable disposition, as well as exceedingly lovely in her perSon and manners. What a treaSure is she to this Frankland ! He is very Sond of her, I believe, thougli I have raiSed all this dust about him. Who the devil would not doat on Such a creature ? It is almost criminal to attempt to teaSe her by Such a piece of I 5	vile
lyS The Disinterested Marriage.
vile deceit as I have pradliSed ; yet, in love and in war, stratagems are fair. Besides, if I treat her with as much tenderneSs as this Frankland does, she will loSe nothing by the change : one handSorne young fellow is as good as another, I imagine; and most women think So : but this charming woman differs as much from her fex^ by her strange perverfeneSs, as by her perSonal allurements. 1 SuppoSe, therefore, that there can be no hopes at preSent, or very faint ones, for
Your sincere friend,

MiSs Plastow to Lady Lucy.
I HAVE just received another letter from Lord Ashbourne ; it is the most Satisfadlory one I have yet Seen of his writing. He has opened his whole heart to Lady Bell: she gives him up, and now he is only apprehensive that I should think, him incapable of constancy, from having changed merely in conSequenee of .meeting with, a woman whom he liked better. However, tho* many objedliions might be fairly made to Such a variegated condudl, I am, I confeSs,' too'much prejudiced in his favour, to imagine 1 that I shall ever'have reaSon to repent of my partiality •■'for him. He is certainly very-amiable: he
16	is
i5o The Disinterested Marriage.
is the man my Sather choSe for me: ought not my father’s choice to carry a strong recommendation with it ? For my part, I own it has great weight with me ; but be that as it will,' it is a fine thing to have So excellent an apology for the indulgence of my inclination. You V' ould, 1 am afraid, rank me among the. vainest of women, and charge me with being intoxicated with the adulation of my lover, were I to relate the most trifling passages in Lord Ashbourne’s letter concerning mySelf: yet I may tell you—I ought, indeed, to tell you, of the extreme good nature of Lady Bell Wallace. She has behaved, my Lord Says, not only with the greatest propriety, but in the most friendly manner to him; and she has Spoken things in my praiSe, which she could have learnt from no body except Lady Lucy;
The Disinterested Marriage. i8i
cy: to ^ou therefore I am, in fad, indebted for them. She wishes me happy with my Lord, and does me the honour to desire my acc^uaintance and friendship — My Lord Speaks of her in the highest terms, in the most reSpedlful terms, and tells me, that no woman ever heard Such a declaration as he was obliged to make against herSelf—and strongly against his will—with So much patience and good humour. She is; I dare Say, a great deal handSomer and better than me\ but while my Lord looks on me with partial eyes, I cannot be unhappy. He talks of coming over immediately: nothing however should prevent my paying your Ladyship my sincere compliments in perSon, on the re-establishment of your own health, and the continuance of your little Son’s, if the distance between us at preSent did not

Lady Lucy to Lady Bell.
I THANK yoti for your last letter, my dear Bell, and for your kind enquiries after me: I have beeri confined by a lying-in,, but I am well rewarded Sot all I Suffered during my confinement,
The Disinterested Marriage. 183
ment, by the birth of one of the Sweetest boys you ever Saw; to whom I ani as happy in being a nurSe as a mother. The dear little fellow promiSes to re-Semble my amiable Frankland, who is full as fond of him as 1 am; and who treated me, while I was in a Situation which required his'tenderest attentions— But I should consider that you are not yet married, my dear Bell, and cannot, therefore, relish thpSe affectionate effusions which involuntarily stow from my pen. — I will restrain them, and make fame reply to your last letters.
I am pleaSed to hear that you are free from an engagement which would not have been produclive of real felicity to you ; and I think I know enough of love, to be certain, that without it, without mutual love, there can be no
happineSs
^ %
184 The Disinterested Marriage.
happineSs in the marriage-state. I am pleaSed too, methinks, to find that Lord Ashbourne has behaved with So much frankneSs, and that you., my dear, have listened to reaSon against yourSelf with Such temper: for, however grating the declaration uttered by his Lordship might have been to your ear, it has, certainly, releaSed you from an infinite deal of anxiety. Where is the woman who can be happy, without possessing the heart of the man whom she marries ?
You ash me what the world Says of you ; and you desire me to inform you of the opinions of your friends and acquaintance here concerning your con-dudl, if I am not quite rusticated.—I am indeed rusticated to Such a degree, that 1 am looked upon as a perSon totally
dead
The Disinterested Marriage. 185
dead to the world—that is, to the polite part of it—absolutely lost in obScurity ; you must not, therefore, expedt the wished-for intelligence from me.—To convince you now of the truth of this assertion — Mr. Frankland and I have not been taken notice of by a Single creature among our friends and acquaintance, Mr. Deshorough, MiSs Plastow, and Mr. Fanshaw excepted.—You will, probably. See Mr. Fanshaw at Paris, if he is not yet arrived. He came here with a compliment from my aunt Selby, and desired to stand godfather to my boy ; to whom, as well as to Mr. Frankland and mySelf, he behaved in the gen-teelest manner, in the most friendly manner imaginable. As to the herd of great and gay,' with whom I uSed to be So familiar, not one of them will conde-fcend to look upon the farmer’s wife,
now

now she has laid aside the fine Lady. Yet I can Sincerely affure you, my dear Bell, that I feel not a moment’s uneasineSs at ' their neglecst. I know mySelf So much happier than I should have been in the most exalted Sphere of life, without Mr. Frankland, that while he continues to be pleaSed with me, I shall, never repine: nay, should he change,. I shall derive Some conSolation from the recoliedHon of my having been once the happiest of women: of my having enjoyed a feli-city which I never could have expedied with any other man. There was Something in his looks and manners which struck me when I first beheld Him; and the similitude which I afterwards diSco-^ vered in our taistes and tempers, attached me very cloSely to him.—I have never had occasion to alter my Sentiments about him : I am perfedlly Satisfied with

To give you a Specimen of the way of the world, I will communicate a little anecdote concerning Charlotte Wills.— You remember MiSs Wills : her father, though a very considerable merchant, met with disappointments which rendered him unable to leave her any fortune. She was left, indeed, entirely to the care of Lady Bridgen, her father’s Sister, that she might be provided for, and rife, by her accomplishments, from nothing, as her aunt had done before her. MiSs ^ Wills was always, you know, reckoned very pretty : and she at last managed
matters So well, that old Lord C-----,

Being, weary of mixing with pleaSurable parties, in which he can have no share, and being adviSed by his physicians to a. change of air, and. a more tranquil state of life than he could lead in London,., he has hired a houfe within a mile of us.~ Two or three mornings ago, as it was a fine, clear frost, I had a great mind to take a walk with my maid, and my boy. The air,
I thought,, would do the child good and I went with him mySelf, that I might be Sure he would not. be kept out too long. The pleafantneSs of the walk, and my attention to my boy, carried me, imperceptibly, farther from honie than 1 had, at first, intended.—On a fudden the wind changed, and a drizzling shower came on, which was by no means agreeable

I really became quite anxious, and took off my cloke to cover him, in Spite of .the remonstrance of my maid, who aS-Sured me, more than once, that I should catch my death. At that instant a post-chaiSe and four, with the most elegant liveries, whifked by. As I was in a ■dirty part of the road, I was Splashed all vOver by the horScs from head to foot: R very fashionable female then thrusting her neck out at the window, ordered the carriage to stop. — Two footmen, in conSequence of her orders, who followed on horSeback, came up, and told me their Lady desired I would step into the chaiSe. I heard the invitation with pleasure, as I had been very uneaSy about my boy ; and taking him from his maid,

Lady Lucy “ Frankland ! Is it possible a woman of “ your quality to be on foot! and in “ this trim too, loaded with a child !

I thought it odd, I confeSs, that she never mentioned the name of Maria, as she uSed to be frequently at our houSe.

Pulling her down on my lap, I then related, circumstantially, every thing relating to Maria. To tell you how she received intelligence, which any woman in her situation would have thought the most unwelcome, is impossible. She looked unutterable things : she Said little however—she only called me her amiable, her excellent Frankland ; her dear,-her tender Charles —Smiled —and wept When I ashed her if the precious tears which watered her cheeks were a pardon for my follies — She anSwered— “ No—they flow from excefs of joy—-“ I rejoice at your having no faults which stand in need of forgiveneSs—■ y No man, except yourSelf, would have K 4	y So

My dearest Lucy will, I hope, at last, be rewarded for her extreme condescension in. accepting of a man with So Small a fortune as mySelf., She has received news of the death of Mr. Me-nel, at Montpellier, just as he was upon the point of being married. As he was her father’s brother’s Son, and as he made no will, my wife comes into the possession of a very ample fortune by inheritance. She inherits, indeed, every thing belonging to him. This considerable— and unexpedled—acquisition, however, Seems only to give her joy by

enabling her to make me Some amends for having married an indigent woman of quality, as Jhe calls herfelf. For my own part, I am chiefly pleaSed with it as it will throw her into the Sphere of life in which she was born—in which she is thoroughly qualified, in every reSpedh, to shine. I am Sufficiently rich in the poffession of her; richer with her than if I was possessed of all the^ treaSures of the east. I wish not for myfelf more than 1 enjoy: but I have long earnestly wished that my Lucy was in a situation to live in a manner Suitable to the rank to which she was born. 7 he more ready she is to give up the indulgencies to which she has a right, the more indulgencies does she deServe. She de-Serves every thing the heart of man can invent to make her blessed. I rejoice,

I never think of my foolish trifling with Maria, but with the utmost contempt for Nr, with the greatest detestation of myfelf.
I knew not, till a few days ago, that my dear Lucy had still farther rcaSon to thiijk meanly of me. Mrs. Bowen came to tell me that she had Something to communicate to m.e, which would, she believed, give me pleaSure.— “ MiSs ‘‘ Waters,” Said she, “is gone into Lei-“ cestershire, to live near her father, y upon an annuity of fiSty pounds,

“ which Sir George CaSwell has just “ Settled upon* her, in conSequence of “ a promise she made to do every thing in her power, to draw you away from ‘‘ Lady Lucy; against whom he had, “ I find, the most infamous designs.”
I told Mrs. Bowen, that I had always SuSpedted Sir George of being very impertinent to my wife: but that, as site had never complained of his behaviour, 1 hoped I had been mistaken.
“ You were not mistaken,” replied Mrs. Bowen, “ Lady Lucy never “ mentioned any thing relating to Sir “ George to me; but I know he was “ very much your enemy, as MiSs Wa-“ ters informed me that he, the very

I anfwered, that it might be So ; but that my wife had concealed Sir George’s beaviour to her from nte; adding, that if I had been acquainted with it, I certainly should have demanded Satisfaction of him for So groSs an inSult to us both.
“ For that reaSon,” Said Mrs. Bowen, my Lady, I imagine. Suppressed it; “ but MiSs Waters communicated to “ me all that passed, having received “ her intelligence from Sir George him-“ Self, who upbraided her, becauSe he had “ not been more Succefsful; telling her, “ at the Same time, that Lady Lucy “ declared she could not expedl to keep “ So agreeable, So amiable a man as you

Here is a woman, Deshorough ! — What true greatneSs of mind is united with her charming perSon > How I adore her! How justly has she been provoked to be diScontented with me ; to distrust me 1 Yet ever, in appearance. Satisfied, ever kind, ever obliging, it was impossible for me to imagine, during the provocations I gave her, that she had heard the Slightest whiSper of detraction against me.
Leaving Mrs. Bowen immediately, I hastened to my dearest girl, to tell her that every hour brought fresh proofs of the excellence of her disposition, and of her tenderneSs for me. I told her alSo,

“ I would rather have endured the

She adlually trembled while she Spoke theSe words, apprehensive of my still retaining a Sufficient quantity of reSentment to make me quarrel with Sir George. I looked, most probably, as if I thought him deferving of the Severest chastisement ; fcr she earnestly conjured me to forget what was past, and to regard Sir George as a man to be treated only with negled and contempt.

He never Saw a man So anxious about a wife (he tells me) So eager to pleaSe her, as he was to pleaSe you, at a time when L %	every

every proof of tenderneSs and attention was required, to alleviate the pain you necessarily endured in the most trying of all Situations. I am very glad to hear that there is one good and considerate man existing. I told Fanshaw So.—He replied, with a vivacity peculiar to him-Self — “ Do you think there is but one ?
“ Take me^ and make me the fecond “ best and happiest hushand in the y world.’*
Before I could anSwer this modest request, a letter was brought me from Lord Ashbourne.—Had not Mifs Plafiow and my dear Louifa been mentioned in every fecond line, I should have aclually mistaken it for a love-letter to my Self; So full was it of tender epithets, and Soft, descriptions.

I THANK you, my dear Bell, for your last kind and entertaining letter : I thank you for your care about me : it was was kind, but, luckily, it happened to be needleSs. I received the earliest advice of Mr. Menell’s death from a friend, who lately joined him at Montpelier, and who adds, that though he thought himSelf better, he could not have recovered. I had, for Some time indeed before I married, looked upon him as lost, and therefore felt not So much as I should otherwise have done.
I can truly Say, that I did not wish for his fortune. I have, for a long while, been Sensible that happineSs is to be enjoyed
The Disinterested Marriage. 223
joyed to as great a degree without a Superfluity, as with it; yet, as my dear Mr. Frankland deServes every thing, I am glad he is now put into the possession of an ample fortune coming from me^ especially as he is incapable of being dazzled by it, or prompted to quit a mode of life which he has found, by experience. So conducive to the health of his body, and of his mind. He has, indeed, met with Such fuccefs in his farming affairs^ that he intends to purSue them, only in a more extensive manner. He will now have Sums Sufficient for the enlargement of his designs, for the benefit of his poor neighbours, as well as for his own immediate advantage. He purpoSes to Sow more wheat and barley, to increaSe the stock of cattle, pigs and poultry, in order to have it in his power to Supply the poor, and even the middling people, L 4	with

> vfith the necessaries of life, at a reasonable rate.— By theSe. proceedings, by letting Small farstifs to industrious people; and by planting forest-trees, he will, of courfe, improve, his estate considerably in a few years, and be really uSeful to Society.—^How nobly is a large fortune Employed, when it is employed in this 'way !
\
I received, a few days ago, a letter from Lord Grassington, in which he congratulated me on the birth of my Son, and entreated me to permit him to Settle that fortune upon him^ which ought to have been mine>
Mr. Frankland, in reply, told his Lordship, that as his Son would, if he lived, inherit a very large paternal estate,
he

he must decline the acceptance of his offer.	-
Thus you See, my dear, my Charles well knows how to acquit himSelf upoa every important occasion. I confeSs I am charmed with his reply to Lord Graffington,* as well as his anSwer to the numerous compliments and invitations received by us since our elevation. What a strange magnetic power is there in wealth!
We have sheen exceedingly diverted with, the behaviour of our former acquaintance, whom Mr. Frankland has treated, as they deServed, very cavalierly. To the Swymmers, and a few others, we shall continue to be attached; but we are by no means desirous of L' 5	-	'filling

To the Country Bookfellers.
WHEREAS, from our having refufed to let Mr. Baldwin, the Publisher of the London Mag-azine, have any more of our Books, till a realbnable Satisfablion is made to us, by retradling an impudent Falshood ast ferted in his Magazine for December, 7772, relative to two Novels we published, under the Titles of, Th£ Way to Lose Him, and. The Way to Please Him (See our Appeal to the P u B l I c, annexed to the Self-Deceiv’d; or. The History of Lord Byron) we have fufficient Reafon to believe, that Orders coming from the Country to him, and, perhaps, others his Colleagues, will not be complied with, and various malicious and falfe Pretences assigned for fo doing; We hereby acquaint all Country Dealers and others, Ishat, by fending a Stage Coachman, or other Per-fon, to our Shops, they will be immediately Supplied at the London Prices with any of our Books., on paying ready Money for the fame.
F. Noble,
J. Noble.
P. S. As we fell for steady Money only, Letters diredfed to us for Credit will be need- . lefs.
