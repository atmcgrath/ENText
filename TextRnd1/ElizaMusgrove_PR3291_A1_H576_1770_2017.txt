Sir Edward Selwyn
T O
Frederic Selwyn, D/y;
T is even So, my Frederic—-^ j ^ diSeale, by its unexpedled vi-M^^%rove’s, has ex-Jr torted the Secret from me ; and I again repeat, it was her lovely granddaughter, not the village, however de-lightSul its Situation or valuable its inha-h bitants, that I have So long preSerred to all your boasted world.
,S I own it has been at all times astonishing to me, that you, who are a fellow of :	the nicest dilcernment on most occasions,
should not be able to distinguish between stupidity and a Softer cauSe—eSpecially . as you accompanied me down on my A 2	exchan-
/
4 L L T T E R I.
exchanging Eton for this little Ipot, and Spent one happy day with both the ladies; but I beg your pardon ; Eliza, tho’ per-fedly charming, was then only twelve years old—and your honour full twice that term, consequently it was beneath your dignity to bestow much attention on the child, notwithstanding the gld lady’s countenance, where peace and benevolence are So abundantly conSpicuous, isiade a due impression on your Sensibility.
It is with this family (with the addition of one fair neighbour) that Harry Hindley and mySelf have contrived to Spend the chief of our time; with them we contemplated the opening beauties of the East, and confessed the milder graces of the evening ray—in a word, no elegance, wit or vivacity were wanting to gratify the lively wish, or harmonize the Soul,
Thele were the kind of circumstances under which your idle raillery attacked me; you cannot therefore be SurpriSed at its producing no other effedf than contempt for the author—turned of two aiid twenty, and a stranger to the polite follies of the age—a terrible reproach truly
when
LETTERS 5 when in possession oS every rational, every eligible enjoyment, by my continuance in the country.
I have nevertheless been only Seeding a flame that will at length feed on me— Harry Hindley’s heart is equally Subdued by. this divinity ; nor can my tender Tcitiments be once revealed without Sor-ifeiting his friendship and wounding his repoSe.
You are no stranger to Harry’s perfections (from my deScription I mean) either perlbnal or mental; he has indeed by much the advantage of his friend— but whilst I feel and acknowledge the justneSs and propriety of the young lady’s taste, in her too obvious preference of him to all her male acquaintance, I cannot Secure mySeif from the most poignant mortification.
I have had Several opportunities of Soliciting her Savour—but if I had been capable of waving all regard Sor Harry’s peace, I should have found myfelS utterly at a loSs Sor proper language—there is a strange aukwardneSs in diScloSing the
deep-Selt attachment-----but above all
things (Sor I will not attempt to palliate) B 3	the
6 LETTERS
the conviction that I was not the man, clung dole to my boSom, in Spite of all rrjy most reSolute efforts.
Should Mrs. MuSgrove be taken off, I doubt not but the unSortunate con Sequence would be the removal of Eliza to London, where she would be at once beyond the reach both of the wretched Harry and mySelS—there is not, there cannot be So amiable and accomplished a girl in your whole metropolis ; nor would 1 wish even you, with a leSs experienced (I SuppoSe I must not call it a hardened) heart, to behold her.
IS she leaves this place I shall not long continue in it—nothing can compenSate the loSs oS her preSence—she has ever been the grand animation oS the Scene, and the flowers would Saintly bloom the instant she was withdrawn.
I would immediately on Such an event inake you a visit, if my own inclinations \yere all I had to conSuIt—but shall I at last prove mySelS devoid of faith, fiiend-ship, and humanity; and whilst I boldly Seek to conSole my own breast, plunge a dagger in my Sriend’s,
I have
LETTER I. r
Shave an old aunt at Buxton—dissipation is all I must have in view, nor be too nice as to the means—I will gef to thar’T place,, and trust to you the rest as lord Hindley’s Sriend ; it is impossible but you must be on a good footing with the MuS-groves; and tho’ you must never Suffer either your eye or imagination to dwell on this charming girl, Sshall expeO to be apprized by your pen of every Such pradice in others.
Now I am in the most imminent danger, of becoming the very thing I So much . deSpiie—a wild inconsiderate young , fellow—I have no affedions- to bestow —no eledion to make, and whatever connedion I may be induced to have with the ladies, will at best be merely the amuSement of a heavy hour.
But, Frederic, let this disappointment be produdive of ever Such unpleaSing effeds in my condud, take notice, I will not abate you an inch of that duty or reSped the being born your uncle entitled me to.
The early marriage of your mother, and the late birth of your humble Servant, expoSed you to a double misSortune—the A 4	loSs
8 L E T T E R T.
loSs of an estate, and the curSe of inferiority. All your grandSather’s other boys were SaSely diSpoSed of—when in the very decline of his days—lo! I was brought forth to obScure your fair profpeds, and defeat your glorious Schemes. T© give you your due, however, I must conSeSs you have borne the grievance (ever since my knov/ledge of it at least) with manly fortitude—Sondly claSped your bane in your generous arms, and doated on the mushroom that So unSeaSonably Sprung up in your way. Yes, that you are a valuable nephew, friend, and companion, I have always granted you—but why will you"'not be uniformly valuable— your intimacy with lord Hindley, and the unworthy opinion you entertain of the women, are what greatly disturb me— be admonished—what you now call gallantry, in a more Serious hour will affurae another name—and prove a Source of endleSs and unavailing compunction.
There goes Harry, apprehension and deSpondence on his brow—I cannot blame him—^nor are all my alarms inferior to his.
Mulgrove,
LETTER I. 9
MuSgrove, if fame may be relied on, has So narrow and corrupt a Soul, as to be capable of making an adiual property of his child, and exposing her to Sale at the first promising market.
I should like to receive Ibme account of the whole family as Soon as possible, to enable me to form a just judgment of my Eliza’s situation. If I am not deceived in my opinion of the old fellow’s disposition, my title and fortune would be no ill recommendation of your uncle. But, Elarry, there is the distreSs—was he not the friend of my infancy, the first born objeCl of my tender affcdions—-but shall I then sink under the evil, I dare not attempt to redreSsNo, Frederic; I will (if Mrs. Mulgrove is restored to us) play a more diScreet and polite part.
Harry has hitherto caught all his impressions from me; for the first Sigh that was breathed for MiSs MuSgrove, was breathed by your Edward. Could I with the Same facility but teach him to make a Second choice—it would be a blessed piece of finesse—nor is MiSs Harley in any degree exceptionable (tho’ this un-B 5	happy
lo L E T T E R I.
happy youth, as well as mySelf, considers her as a mere Satellite in compariibn with our Sweet mistreSs)—how would I then bend my muScles to an affedation of a passion I could not feel; and having once fixed him MiSs Harley’s admirer, reaffume my primitive faith, and render us all compleatly happy.
I am Sensible how truly ridiculous I must appear to a man of your cast, who proSeffes himSelS incapable, nay, glories in being of the weakneSs I am now manifesting—but give me leave to tell you in return—that tho’ there may be a joy in your leSs interesting purSuits, it must be a licentious joy; confequently equally delpiSed by the village Swain, as his Softer concerns by you.
I am, Frederic, &c.

And nothing leSs, my good uncle, will SatisSy you, than the charadte-ristics of the MuSgrove family—yet am I afraid, my compliance with your re^ quest will be productive of very Small Satisfadlion to you, as the lines are by no means favourable to yours, or your Harry’s caule.
Mulgrove’s connexions' are gay and extensive, but for your comfort, he brings but few visitants home—declaredly to avoid the restraint his wife’s preSence would communicate, where licentioufheSs pastes for wit, or the forward cenSures of his upstart children. He drinks, he games, and is quite the debauchee, but is not only tolerated in all his vices and
impro^
12 LETTER II.
improprieties to the utter refiedtion on the taste of his friends, but abfolutely careS-Sed, for being a man of entertaining faculties—and whilst the world will continue this pradtice, what reformation can be expedfed I His principles, I believe, either moral or religious, are still unfixed ; and So little tenderneSs, nature, and Sensibility has fallen'to his share, that provided his own purpoSes are but anSwer’d —no Sacrifice would be deemed too great in his estimation. He married from the unworthiest of motives—Self-in ter estedneSs and Self-gratification. The lady’s birth and accomplishments flattered his vanity, her perSon pleaSed his eye, while the mild perfedtions of her heart promiSed him the utmost exultations of tyranny and pride. She yielded herSelf implicitly to the will of her relations, and has for years endured the most ungenerous treatment whlhoLit complaint—he boasts that never man was more blessed, tho’ no man on earth ever made Such ill returns for unremitting indulgence as himSelf.
His daughter Mary inherits all the graces of her Sather’s perSon as well as temper, and it is So natural for us to
doat
LETTER IT. ig
doat on our own likeneSs, that you cannot be Surprhed when I tell you, she holds the reins of the whole family. Two little boys and a Sweet-diSpoSed girl are wholly at her mercy and command ; for she gives what impression she pleaSes oS every adion or objedt to MuSgrove’s breast, an unhappy circumstance for your Eliza.
But, Edward, is not your behaviour very extraordinary reSpeding this young lady—if she had on any occasion acknowledged her preSerence of Harry to yourSelS; Silence and sighing would, I
grant you, be your only reSource-
but as the cafe is, how can you be certain, of her Sentiments—I would bring matters to a fair trial—he should make his application ; and if SucceSs was not his portion, you might then honestly inquire what you had to trust to. Forgive my prescribing to you, but I have no patience with your chimerical nnhap-pineSs. If you can strike out any method of rendering me ferviceable to you, either by pen or perSon, you well know how ready I am to obey your commands

LETTER III.
Mifs MusGROVE to Mifs Harley.-
I THANK you, my dear good girl, for your well-timed eondolance—to cloSe the eyes of a tender and valuable relation, was a stvere and melancholy tash, especially alone and unassisted by that friend who was never before under a necessity of absenting hcrSelf from the village—the neceffity was, however, no lest ill-timed than indiSpenSible; and we ought both of us to Submit to it without complaint.
I am afraid this misfortune will be pro-dudtive of many others—So alarming a change in my circumstances, cannot but be Succeeded by as alarming a change in my Situation ; for you are very Sensible that my dear grand-mamma’s jointure (which devolves to her eldest Ion) tho’ considerable, was but ill-proportioned to her generous heart. Was there a diS-treSs that ever reached her knowledge she
could
i6 LETTER III.
could resist relieving; or a grieS that wa? unwept or uncompashoned by her ?
My dear child, she would frequently fay to me, it will never be in my power to make a proper provision Sor you—but I will teach you the happy art of being Satisfied with a little—your father is a man of fine genius and abilities, and your mother’s fortune will enable him to push himSelf in life—but his family is large, and he has already exhausted his patrimony as a younger brother—therefore tho’ there is no reaSon to apprehend your wanting a provision—there can be no harm in guarding against every possible contingence—and believe me, the girl who has not learned to confine her wishes, and regulate her expences—and contemplated as well the humble as exalted walks of life, is but ill-qualified to make a figure in either the one or the other. My few jewels, plate, and a very Small reServe of money, is all I have to bestow—yet perhaps even thoSe trifles may give you an uneaSy distindtion in the houSe of your father, whenever you may have occasion to return to it—Brothers -and Sisters will think equality their due
—on
LETTER III. 17
—on which account it must be your buSi-nest to conciliate their affections by an obstinate perSeverance in kindneSs, let their conduct be what it may—always remembering, that no provocation on their part can excuSe your breach of sisterly propriety; and that envy and conScious inferiority are no unuSual concomitants.
This lesson is now become my only relburce; and it is by a proper observance of it alone, that my little bark can Sail with any tolerable Security. My brothers and Sisters are almost entire strangers to . me in every particular—I have indeed been brought up with the tenderest impressions of them, but what I have to expect at their hands is altogether uncertain ; yet the being the eldest of all my father’s children, I should imagine, my Harley, could not fail to give me Some consideration—and the rest will in great meaSure depend on my own behaviour. My mother’s disposition I know to be far from exceptionable—bear Soft, my pen— for is it not my other parent 1 would arraign—-we will, we ought to leave all ». theSe things in the boSom of futurity, nor
preSump-
i8 L E T T E P. IIL
preSumptuoufiy rend them forth before their time.
I have but one real difficulty to contend with—Our friend Harry Hindley is now one and twenty, and has too much thrown off the boy, to beany longer.in*-dulged in all thoSe pleasing familiarities he So late enjoyed. The parting Scene, how shall I Support it—liSe itSelS is leSs precious in my estimation than his most agreeable company. What value can I then Set upon his esteem and friendship,
•—to be Separated, to be forgot, to never lee him more:—are not theSe lines truly Severe ?,
Lord Hindley is^ indeed, an intimate of my father’s—but Harry is too unfor^ tun ate a Son, to claim any toleration on that account. He could, not visit me, however prompted by inclination; nor if even that was praDicablc, would it be possible for the peculiarity of his attention to eScape the observation of my relations—he has> nothing to recommend him to the approbation of age and ex^* perience—for there, there, my Harley, would that finished form, that inexpressibly
LETTER III. 19 bly meritorious mind, plead with httle Succels—it is fortune alone that captivates —Yet be it So—I shall then be engaged in a very different manner to what I have been accustomed; perhaps have the care of domestic concerns—and may not have leiSure to Seel what now appears to me an intolerable grievance. I am now in my eighteenth year; and as my beloved grand-mama has thought fit to appoint that the diScretional period, I ought to give mySelf conSequence, and be an example to all thoSe that are younger than mylelS—and you, my kind girl, will, at your return, infallibly reconcile him to the necessity of my affairs.
Perhaps it may be best for both, that our friendship should know Some bounds ■—my profpedts are as little flattering as his—nor must I ever hope to be lady Hindley. ,
It is a double aggravation of all my distresses, that I shall not have the hap-pineSs of Seeing you before I leave the country—but my mother will be down to-morrow ; and I fear, another day or
two

LE.D

I, E T T E R IV.
From the Same to the Same.
IT is all over, my Harley, and I at a most wretched distance from the happy village. Harry made many efforts to Speak to me, but Sir Edward was the unkind and perpetual interruption; nor do I think I shall ever forgive him.
My mother tenderly reproved me for my too apparent reludance to accompany her ; and declared, that iS she had Sore-Seen the alienation of my affedions would have been the conSequence oS my being brought up from under my paternal root, no consideration on earth should have prevailed on her to have Suffered me to quit it.
Happy perhaps had it been Sor her poor Eliza, iS—but it cannot be recalled, and we must make the best of it.
The young friends begged leave to Sup with us, or more properly to be permitted to sit at the Supper-table—they neither
22 L E T T E R IV. ther of them eat any thing, nor was my appetite over keen—Sir Edward, with an osticiouSneSs that hurt me no leSs on the rccolledion, than in the pradice, for ever met my eye^; and as I had not the confidence to indulge them under his observation, as I could have wished, I fixed them on my plate, in anguistrand diffa-tisfadion.
The next morning brought them again to the hall—my distreSs was unfpeakable —and to compleat the whole, when we got into the chariot. Sir Edward contrived to fasten my mother upon his friend, whilst I was compelled to accept his unwelcome hand; and we were Ibon, too Soon, removed beyond the utmost straining of their sight.
We arrived atHanover-fquare only last night, and at a very late hour, a Slight accident or two unexpededly detaining us; and as I was much Satigued, (at least in mind) my good mother insisted on my retiring, aSter a little refreshment, without waiting my Sather’s return from a neighbouring tavern, where he happened to be engaged. But notwithstanding I went to bed, repoSe was what I Sought in
vain.
LETTER IV. 23
vain, until about three in/the morning, when I was instantly awaked, and terribly alarmed by a conSuSion of male voices in the dining-room.
I hope theSe midnight revels are not very uSual—but, my dear mother, if you can patiently Support them, well may I—
Six and thirty is too early a period Sor Ib fine, Ib amiable a woman to sink into the / groSSest negledt-—I have done, I have done, my friend, and do you obliterate the daring cenSure.
You cannot imagine how my sisters are improved since our happy visit to them in Lincolnshire-Patty will never-
theless, I believe, be still the Savourite—• she has Such an uncommon share of fweetneSs and Sensibility; and her attention to her mother is So truly amiable. The two boys appear haughty and confident----but there is no forming a proper
judgment, on So short an acquaintance . —and I find in all events they are more pitiable than blameable—as top great indulgence will ruin the best turned disposition. I am impatient to know if you have Seen any thing of Harry, and how he bears my Sudden departure—Friendship,
j
24 L E T T E R IV. ship, like his, I am convinced, cannot be affeded—I feel I am Sure much more than I could wish upon the occasion—tho’ indeed you will not allow me the landioi he assumes, but call my attachment by too foSt a name.
I have promised my sisters to preSent each of them Ibme little ornament out of my colledion the day I am eighteen, as they will then become my undoubted property, on the strength of which, I flatter mySelf, the preceding months will paSs Smoothly away—Shall I conSeSs to you, my Harley, that I had the mortification to find it necessary in Some degree to Sacrifice my interest to my peace----And
what was of tenfold weight with me, preserve the Sacred remains of my venerable and indulgent grand-mama from the breath of cenSure and condemnation.
You must not, however, judge Mary’s heart with too much Severity, (for Patty’s behaviour is unexceptionable) vanity and ambition have not been peculiarly dealt out to her, but is the portion of us all; tho’ at certain periods they may be So entirely Suppressed, as to deceive our friends
no
L E T T E R IV. 25 no leSs than oiirSelves, into a belieS, that they are no part of our composition.
It would be an infinite advantage to Some of my relations, to converSe, to be acquainted, with our Harry Hindley. Has he not been elegantly bred ,? can any Sentiments be more noble, generous, or tenderly charitable, than thoSe he is endued with—and are we not very apt to copy our companions—yet it would ill become me, to attempt bringing Such a thing to bear—it is, my dearest girl, in your power, and yours alone, (if a happy Summons was to draw him to town) to give him a decent plea for introducing himSelf—■ Ought I to wish to be understood—but can I deny that a letter Srom you would be abundantly grateful to me, from any bearer —and particularly—you will pity the folly and weaknels
of your
Eliza.

Mifs Harley to Mifs Musgrove.
HOW compleatly miSerable, my dear Eliza, has your departure rendered me ! Never talk to me of your Harry—	*
what are your Harry’s Sufferings to mine —his maSculine charader v/ill enable him to Sollow whereSoever you sty—but I, alas, must yield to the helpleffneSs, the insufficiency of my Sex; and whilst my heart pants after you and London, remain in the odious Solitude of miy ancestors.
Why have I not expressions adequate
to my feelings----my stars, the fates,
what would I not accuSe---yet you can
give up your Harley with an offensive phi-loSophy, and only sigh ard lament for a silly boy ; who, with all his deServings, ought not Surely to have been admitted in competition with Such a friend as I.
It is a grievous refiedlion, that, in all probability, if we could have continued a Sew months longer as we were Situated,
only
L E T T E R V. 27
only a few days ago, Edward and Harry had been our own. Yet I verily believe, on more mature consideration, it is much better as it is,—for if I have any discernment (and who except yourSelS would once dare to call it in question) my fair Sriend was the univerSal deity.
Harry has a warmth in his nature, that cannot be Ib easily restrained as the more amiable Edward’s—but, depend upon it, the one was your open, the other your Secret admirer; and that all that behaviour that gave you So much dilpleaSure at parting, claimed, at least, your compasi • lionate toleration.
Believe me, my dear Eliza, the hours we have Spent, the days we have shared, can never be Sufficiently regretted ——It was innocence—the most refined and perSed innocence, that gave the gostt to our enjoyments—not one ungentle paS-sion to ruffle the Sweet Serenity—not one stern guardian to Srown us into discontent ; but all was harmony, and all was love.
I SuppoSe you would be very glad, notwithstanding all my wiSdom, iS I would quit parade, and come to the point.

Well then, my uncle’s di(position no Sooner permitted me to return, than the drooping youths preSented themSelves, the mournSul mementos oS my misSortunes—
I would have conSoied, I would have rallied them—idle attempt—but I will hastily wipe ^away my tears, lest they should prove contagious.
Yet, Set your heart at rest; your beloved Hindley’s grieS is in no danger of destroying him—I grant you it is lively, it is incessant—it is, indeed, to Say the truth, very little inSerior to my own—• but it is unrestrained—O think, iS you can, unmoved, of the lover and the friend; how strong, how generous must his confiifts be—but he is born as unSor-tunate as mySelf, and will live and die a prey to hopeleSs affedtion.
The arrival of each of your letters was likewise produdive oS a visit Srom Hind-ley ; the sty inquisitive youth, it Seems, Spent halS the day at the post-houSc, and ■ was wnth me by the time I had broke the
Seals---the charaders, the well knovrn

He has communicated his intention of leaving us this very week, and Harry is reSolved to remain as short a time aSter his friend as possible.

but his vivacity, and my gravity, are . glaring and irreconcileable contradidlions.
Was there a possibility of awakening: him to a SenSe of his felicity, I should-.never be dissatisfied with the place he Siolds in your esteem—but depend upon it, my too SuSceptible girl, he will Soon become a general admirer of the Sex ; nor once think of fixing (agreeable to the condudt oS all Such lively gentlemen) until age or infirmity point out the necessity.

Lord Hindley is frequently at our houst, and I assure you, honours your friend with peculiar attention—Did he know a man that he could perSuade himSelSmeritedme, how warmly would he eSpouSe his interest —can he forget how nearly he himSelf is allied to the first excellence ; or does he only addreSs me in the true courtier stile, without either meaning or Sentiment?
1 have Sormed a design, and you, my Harley, must pray for its SucceSs, To pleafe Lord Hindley, to communicate a favourable impression of my dcServings to his heart, is now my only care ;—nor have I any reaSon hitherto to repent my toil—He every day Seems to regard me with additional complacence, and to lend
a more willing ear to all my prattle---1
have even gone So far as to mention my
intimacy with his Son-----and if he has
much penetration, I doubt not but he will read the rest—how alarming this inSatua-tion—what rest—what is there for him to read ? My forward inclinations, and his Son’s modest reServe—I would, but cannot
LETTER VI. 33
nor Spare mySelf this mortifying convidfion oS my indistretion and folly.
Yet if this lord was diSpoSed to be generous, who can deny that he has it in his power ?—Harry has been a great Sufferer by his gaiety and negledt oS him;—his unkindneSs, his extravagance, may not for ever endure—And wc no Iboner become Sensible of our injurious conduct than we are anxious to retrieve it.

His Lordship has made me a preSent of shme little trinkets that belonged to Harry’s mother—which I am to the last degree both proud and vain of possessing—■ Don’t you think, notwidistanding the great improbability—it looks—but you will Smile at the silly girl, yet must in the fame instant compassionate her.

So you are displaying all your fine accomplishments to catch the old Hindley’s approbation, in order to obtain an interest , in his Son.—but I can tell you, it requires >' ho Supernatural wiSdom to foreSee a very, contrary, effed.
His lordship is normuch turned of fifty; and when you, clap his title and fortune in the opposite Scale to his infirmities, can--not be deemed an ineligible lover—•nor would you, in the charader. of a mother--in-law, SaiSto shine.
Harry’sv Sensibility is too strong to be trifled with; or what charming entertain-menti might your far-fetched Scheme have produced—but as the cafe is, l am obli--ged to be no ieSs silent than the grave.
Indeed,

Indeed, my dear, you must be very cautious what connections you Sorm, or you will be the destruction oS this young fellow, who, I am positive, is not half So Sensible of his own existence, as your charms; or would Suffer any blessing to come in competition with yOur dear, your desirable approbation.
I have my regrets, my languishments ; —for Sir Edward Selwyn is no longer at the village—but I am reSolved to turn all my attention to the Supporting and con-Soling your poor drooping Harry. This Second stroke, my Eliza, has quite undone him ; nor is his obdurate father to be prevailed upon to allow him to come to London, notwithstanding all the judicious remonstrances of the good old parlbn, who insists upon it, that it is the greatest injustice both to his pupil and the public, to let him remain any longer in obScurity.
TheSe Lords are a kind of hard natur’d beings, I think—one would imagine be would be impatient to behold So rising a genius—but on the contrary——^he is meanly aSraid of being elbowed at places of polite reSort, by So accomplished a youth as all the world would proclaim his Son to

Sir Edward is now at Buxton ; he mentions both the place and the company with great indifference—I know a lady, whoSe preSence could render it a paradiSe, cor can I wonder it is tasteleSs without her.

I am grieved to hear oS your father’s,

But to leave yourSelf pcnny-leSs, to a<5t in diredt opposition to the will of the dead-— to See miSery gathering around you; and instead of sheltering yourSelf, invite its utmost violence, appears to me to be contrary to every dictate of nature and propriety.

YOU.D Salutary, your most judicious advice,, m.y Harley, reached me too late to be Serviceable—I had, in .a moment of filial apprehenSion, offered my father all-—and with great difficulty prevailed upon him to promiSe to accept it.
It is'a grating circumstance, ray Eliza, cried' he, to be compelled by cruel
necessity to rob my ehild^-why will
you enter So tenderly into the distresses of a man, whom th^lworld in general is difpoSed to condemn for inattention to
his family, and freedom of living-*
should you. repent' your generosity—you are fenSible of my inability to restore what you are So desirous to Sorego. Consider well the conSequences, for be assured, no evil in nature would beay So heavy on the heart of your Sather, as
the

the brow-beatings of his own miserable offspring.
How was my very Soul Searched by this behaviour—O Sir, Said I, Spare me,
I beSeech you, on this occasion-you
gave me being, and it is alone by your parental indulgence, that I am in a capacity of being Serviceable to you — you have no child that could do leSs for you, and it was your own pleaSure, that I should recommend mySelf to my dear grand-mamma; or you would have been master of what I am entitled to by a different claim'—only permit me to enjoy the felicity of a paternal roof, and an equivalent portion of your approbation with my brothers and sisters; shall I not then be amply reqompenced
There is Something great, returned my father, I must confeSs, in this condiA
of youtvS, if it is but Sincere-women
are often Subject to theSe Softnesses, thefe starts of heroiSm—Yet I will not prejudge you-—nor shall I long be impoSed upon—your will must be as pliant, your obedience as exemplary, and your SelS-negleft as meritorious on every future demand, as you have now shewn them,

or I shall deem you tardy---1 Suffer no
one to contend with me—are you equal, think you, to all that may be required gS you ?
Be affured, Sir, that ycur happinefs will at all times be dearer to me than even life itSelS—nor can I prove So weak or unworthy as to make a merit oS my duty-----do you but obliterate the re-
membrance oS this day’s tranSadlion as perSedlly ffrom your breaSt as I lliall
from mine-----He preSSed my hand and
retired : my mother’s tender proSessions were inexpressibly wounding, but I at length Soothed all her agitations into peace.
And now, my dear, am I as destitute oS every hope or expeftation of a provision, as if my worthy affe<ftionate grand-mamma had been ever So deficient in her care or kindneSs, But let it go '—the necessity was irresistible; and if the grave has knowledge of the actions of the living, even the pardon of my indulgent benefaflreSs must be mine.
Yet my Situation (I cannot SuppreSs, the acknowledgment) v/ill never be a happy one—I have neither friend nor
companion
LETTER VIH. 43
companion in any of my relations, nor the power or opportunity oS Seeking them Srom any other quarter; and my days are past in recolledions that have much more oS pain than pleaSure in them. You must not mistake me, tho’ the unhappineSs 1 thus lament, is alone produced by the malignity oS my Sister Mary’s disposition—she governs the family, possesses both her Sather’s heart and ear; nor dare my mother indulge the affectionate impulSe oS her nature, or the Sweet Patty her tenderneSs, under the malicious eye of this overgrown Savourite, for Sear of misrepresentation.
Should any thing very unfortunate deprive me of a paternal roof, be affured, the village is the place I would sty to—• I know the generosity of your composition too well not to confide in it; nor will I have So mean an opinion of my own abilities as to conceive mySelf incapable of being ufeful in shch a family as yours. Perhaps, my dear girl, our' re-union is much nearer than you may imagine; fori have no Small reaSon to shlped that my little Sacrifice will rather amuSe than Satisfy my father’s creditors ;

^44 LETTER VIII. and that a still greater calamity is in store for us—to aggravate all which, it is whiS-pered,, that Some late ill-Succeffes at play are on the point of tranSpiring-—and heaven only knows where it will end.
I have likewise another alarm that I must'Communicate; this miSerably mistaken father, has, my dear, a strange Scheming turn, and I overheard him the other day, lamenting to one oS his bottle companions, that all his girls were not marriageable; as he could then diSpoSe of them to the greatest advantage—but a brace or two of years, he added,, (with Some expressions that shock me on the recolledtion) would blast the flattering proSped:,, and render them drugs upon his hands.
Here I conSels I feelmySelf vulnerable —-Povert}^, all the evils oS liSe that are in general the most Sormidable to a youthful mind, have no terrors, for me when compared with, renouncing my last Sond hope of one day—but Spare me, my good Harley,, and let me fly the horrible idea.
And yet to behold' the too probable, if not actually impending stroke, a?td
not
LETTER VIII. 45
not endeavour to mitigate it, if to avert it Siiould be impracticable, is the height of Solly and madnels. I will therefore from this hour, begin to prepare myfelf —and as a most essential step, remember, the name of Hindley must never more fall from our pen—to Seed So unpromising a flame, is to deServedly incur the punishment of disappointment that wcHild infallibly await it. I need not be told that we are both Sufficiently ill qualified for a life of industry and inconvenience ; and I cannot imbibe the extravagant faith, that love alone is a Security for matrimonial felicity.
For me, the lesson of humility is held forth by the hand of reaSon ; nor shall it be held forth in vain—but as Harry is master of many fine accomplishments, and So nearly allied to nobility, he may confidently look forward to better days. No woman of whatever rank or Sortune would be degraded by her election of him, and I now as Sincerely wish the friendship he bears me may never prove an impediment to his advancement, as I was once childishly ambitious oShis being irrevocably attached to me.
How

Was it not for this communication of my miSery, my heart must burst.
There are but few things I would he-'sitate to do to Save my Samily from ruin —I have no apprehension of death that is in any degree comparable with my apprehensions for their Safety—But it is life, my Harley, that is too much for me to Support, and how long I may linger ; an alarming uncertainty !

Dear Madam^
My Sister bids me write, but how little does she consider the many impediments I have to contend with— can I behold her tears and restrain my own ; she that has ever been So tender and generous to us all—indeed, indeed, I cannot; nor does it become me to east my afiiitfted heart; Sor it is a terrible sin for children to condemn their parents. Yet my sister, that is goodneSs itSelS, bid me tell you all ; do you think, madam, she meant or knew what she Said ? If file did, I need not hesitate a moment; for it cannot be improper on any occasion to follow her instriidSions.
My Sather (I could almost be So wick>^ cd as to call him by another name) entered the room with all the good humour you can coiiceive, attended by Lord Hindley, a clergyman, and one more gentleman. My Sister—had you VoL. I.	D	but

I held one oS her hands—.a cold dew was on. it, .and she was Seized.v/ith repeated tremblings—I thought she would have died before ithe cruel gentlemen had finished their private conversation.
The clergyman then demanding (in the ugliest voice I ever heard) which was the bride, I could .no longer contain raySelf,; but bursting into tears was sternly rebuked by Mr. MuSgrove, and threatened to be turned out oS the room. Lord Hindley is certainly a diSmal looking creature, as well as the most barba-^ rous man on earth----1 would neverthe-
less have married him mySelS iS 1 had been old enough, to have laved my Sister from the mil’ery she endured.
But it could not be; and he advanced to have the ceremony performed—The / hand I held was, it Seems, the hand he wanted—O Sir, cried I, (not knowing
what
LETTER XIII. 75
what I Said) I cannot, cannot part with it—you will kill my Sister, and what will then become of me ?
Stand off, blubbering Sool, laid my father—why, Mrs. MuSgrove, was the perverSe chit permitted to be preSent ? Young ladies on theSe occasions want rather lively friends than whimperers at their elbows—it will Soon be over, however, and then they may retire together if they think proper. Remember, Eliza, continued he, (drawing her Somewhat aside) now is the test of all your heroics—Am I to Spurn you Srom me for the mean reptile I defcribed to you, when you forced your grandmother’s legacy upon me, or will you justify your claim , to my esteem and approbation—Lord Hindley must not be treated indignantly ■—your mother, your beloved Sniveller (meaning me, madam) are entirely at his mercy, therefore either kindly hasten their destruition, or greatly devote your Sweet perSon for their preservation—A mighty grievance the generality of girls would call what you now labour under-—-to be made a lady, and put in polSelsion of jewels, equipage, and all that is fiat-D 2	tering

I hope I shall never See Such another Icene; half dead, and with a countenance all anguish and terror, they hurried over the shocking buSineSs; and she was (tho’ in no degree conSenting) proclaimed Lady Hindley. But can this be right, will not God Almighty be offended with them Sor their wickedneSs ? to call any body married, when they are So inhumanly forced to Say after a

The whole evening was as horrible as the beginning, except with the gentlemen ; who were So inSenSibleas to enjoy them-Selves over repeated bottles ; whilst our utmost endeavours were exerciSed to keep my Sister from Sinking into the grave.
It is Surely a pity that no other method could be fixed on, Sor the happy

OF all the’talks, my dear Edward, you ever impoSed on my friendship, I find mySelf at preSent engaged in the hardest. It is your repeated request— your injundfion, that I should inSorm you oS whatever relates to Mils MuSgrove— Take thereSore my important Suspicions, which I fear are but too well grounded— and bear them like a man.
Your Harry arrived, blooming as his expedtations, and aSter we had exchanged just So many words, as to enable us to understand one another, entreated me t-o accompany him to Mulgrove’s. I had for Some time discovered a mysteriouSnels in lord Hindley’e behaviour—He did, indeed, introduce me at his Sriend’s, but
was
LETTER XV. 85
Was visibly ill-affeded towards my con-tradfing an intiniacy there.
I thought it was very extraordinary for a man (naturally ostentatious) to conceal intentions that did him Ib much honour —and yet Lord Hindley was ever disinclined to make his Son the Subjedt of his conversation, nor on any occasion proclaimed what your letter imported.
MuSgrove and his Lordship were both abSent; the impatient youth then desired that the young lady might be made acquainted with our visit—she came down —Harry’s raptures happily Secured him Srom too nice observations on her altered countenance—but I was peculiarly alarmed by it. Her whole behaviour was constrained and timidly Significant—Now the SoSt eye of compassion was turned upon Harry, and again the Sound of feet in the lobby drew it apprehensively an opposite way—There is no describing it —But at length the opening door threw her into an adstual tremor; which was rather increafed than mitigated, by our being Summoned to attend the brace of unnatural faihers at a tavern.
Harry’s
26 L E T T E R XW Harry’s worthy confidence and lively gratitude were his protedUon—it would,, Said he, (as we passed along) have been equally blameable and impolitic to have, delayed complying with this however unwelcome request ; as I shall Jo Ibon See her again to my utmost Satisfadfiom My lord affedted to receive him with great cordiality—hut be assured, it was only affedted ; and whenever the youth caught at an opportunity to proSeSs his grateSul SenSe of his intended goodneSs,. always interrupted him and changed the Subjedf.
He then told him (ilightly apologizing for the necessity) that he must get him to take a ride into Kent, upon particular buSineSs; he yielded even to this propoSal with astonishing reSolution; only reSolv-ing, as he privately acknowledged to me, to. make Somewhat quicker diSpatch than his Sather had mentioned.
I never once Saw his lordship during his absence. The sixth morning brought him to London; and tho’ aukwardly early Sor a visit, no arguments could prevail upon him to Sorbear attempting at least to See his beloved.
But
L E T T E R XV. 87
But how was he chagrined on finding a coach and Six at the door, and his father condud/ng the half-dying Sair one into it to be conveyed to Bath !
Lord Hindley was confuSed-----Poor
Mils MuSgrove 1-—Harry was permitted just to kifs her hand ; and invited by his tender parent to Sollow them So loon as he was properly invested in his employment.
Yet notwithstanding all his mortification and regret, he is perSedly unSuSpi-cious of his greatest misfortune. Depend upon it. Sir Edward, this most amiable girl is either already (or on the very point of being) Sacrificed to this barbarian of a . lord.
I would adviSe you to go immediately to Bath, and Search into the affair—'On Such a contingence, Harry’s miSery, by being incapable of every Species of alleviation, will claim our united tenderneSs —r*and you may in all reSpeds rely on

He was So very earnest with me to inform lady Hindley of his arrival, that I hurried to the rooms to take her on her

She at length appeared, attended only by her father and sister—I was Ibmewhat Surprised, but not in the least alarmed at the abSence of her lord.

She then inquired aSter her Son’s health (as Site repeatedly called him) and laboured hard to Support the maternal character, until it occurred to her that this too tenderly beloved Son was the peribn that had prevented Lord Bindley’s accompanying

WHAT a miserable tash, my Frederic, have I been engaged in, hope and deSpair alternately rending my heart; the wound was in no degree So dangerous as I apprehended—but Such were the agitations of his mind, that he was frequently delirious, and would for Succeshve hours call upon MiSs Mufgrove to pity and pardon hisrashneSs.
He is now, however. So well recovered as to sit in his chair, and would this morning give me a destription of the Scene between him and his father.
He had, it Seems, formed his whole plan previous to his hurrying me to the rooms; and the instant he found I was out of light, dispatched a Sellow with a message to his lordship, which Soon brought him to the tavern.
When he beheld his ion, he sternly demanded what had induced him to quit
town

I came, Sir, returned Harry, (irritated by this addreSs) to give back the bale,
the inadequate price oS my felicity--------
Could you conceive it possible to silence injuries like mine by So paltry a method what is a provision where life itSelS is not worth that care ? you have robbed me of all that I ever held valuable, and I Icorn to join hands with you on any occasion.
Harry, Harry, anSwered. his lordship, do you know who it is that you are thus inSulting ?
Yes, Sir------you are the man that I
have considered and honoured as my father—but how little your condudl has corresponded with that endearing cha-radler, the v/orld will bear yon vdtneSs— Was I not buried in obScnrity, denied the privilege of a paternal roof, and excluded Srom every, Species of paternal indulgence—until, by Some fatal accident, you discovered it was in your power to effedl my destruction—when I was called E 5	home

What can be the meaning of all this, exckimed his Lordship, (affeding great Surprize) must I believe you inSane ?
0	hypocri-Sy, exclaimed Harry, how ill-befitting the hoary head—And would you, sir, would you meanly insinuate, that what has been So apparently effeded by deliberation, falshood, and contrivance, was founded in ignorance—Would you, can you declare to the wretch now before you, that you were unappriSed of his attachment to MiSs MuSgrove, that dear, that lovely MiSs MuSgrove, who has been the dreadSul Sacrifice of her father’s villainy, and the miSerable purchaSe of her family’s affluence and tranquillity.

Be affured, Sir, I intend to give you full Satisfadion for the indignity you complain of—I Seek no redreSs—O blasting thought!—No redreSs is in your power —You cannot restore her to my hopes, you cannot recall the Sacred ceremony
that

So you have the temerity, returned his Lordship, not only to reproach and condemn where you ought to revere; but to proSeSs an attachment that never could have met with my approbation, had it even been Solicited—The rebellious child sits in judgment on the uncon-troulable father; and whilst he arraigns him of one perhaps ill-adviSed step, ac-‘cuSes himSelS of the most unpardonable.
Your heart, my Lord, Said Harry, is much too callous not to defeat the pur-

Soothed it into repentance, compassion, and generous conSusion—■—I would, by shewing you the Sad product of your industry with relpedt to me, have incited you to Spare the dearer part of me all further persecution—But it will not be:

All my intercourle with Lady Hindley must now be at an end; for as I have on all occasions been the Sriend and confidant of the Son, it cannot be expetsted that the Sather should be over-Sond of my possessing her Ladyship’s ear or approbation.

AF E W days, a very few days ago, my Harley, I believed it impossible for any circumstance to aggravate the miSery of my condition—but evils, I am now convinced, can still be multiplied upon my head ; and it is still possible for me to feel additional aSBidlion.
I informed you that Sir Edward Sel-wyn had more than once paid his compliments to me at the rooms—as al(b the distress I experienced on thoSe occasions, from not only being under the necelsity of avoiding all conversation reSpeding our friend, but treating him with unuSual coldneSs and relerve. But the other evening I was releaSed Srom all restraint, by Lord Hindley’s attending the invitation of a gentleman to a tavern, upon Some particular buSinels.
Sir
LETTER XXI. 111
Sir Edward appeared from the first moment he met my eyes to be fraught with extraordinary intelligence; and I endeavoured to prepare mySelS Sor the interesting rencounter—But judge of my apprehension and conSuSion, when I discovered that Harry was, in all probability, the perSon that had Sent Sor his Lord-ship ; and that Sir Edward had the strongest objedions to their interview—• He left me abruptly—and Such was the agitation oS my mind, that 1 Sainted twice in the rooms, and was conveyed home very much indiSpoSed.
My little Patty’s tendernefs had now an opportunity of displaying itSelf—she omitted nothing in her power to mitigate my Sufferings without even SuSpedting the cauSe—But I was torn with SuSpenSe and anxiety until Lord Hindley’s return, whoSe appearance and behaviour was far from contributing to my repoSe.
He inquired what was the matter with me—then muttered strange execrations; intreated me to take care oS myfelF, and again traverSed the apartment in the most alarming diSorder.
I did
II2 LET T E R XXI.
I did at last venture to ash him what had diScornpoSed him—He darted astern look at me—when Seeming to recolleft himSelf—it is oS no conSequence, Said he, only recover your health and all will be well—^^y our health is oS all others the most desirable acquisition.'
On one of his ruffles I perceived two or three Spots of blood—Harry’s blood, whiSpered my too apprehensive heart— I thought I should have died with horror —and his Lordfiiip was evidently but ill diSpoSed to gratify my anxious inquiries •—He was Summoned to Supper, my own restedions were all I had to feed upon.
I was more than once tempted to have diScloSed my Sentiments to the little good-natur’d girl, and have got her by Some means to Search out the particulars of Harry’s proceedings—But heaven was too gracious to permit me to sink So much beneath m.y uSual dignity ; notwithstanding all the delusions of a fond imagination—that would have represented the demands of duty and conscience as proper to be anSwered—and that not to bestow attention on fiich a Son, was an affedation that could not Sail to betray

We travelled all that day, and late in the evening reached what they call the Grove; my father returned, I think, they tell me to London.

Sir Edward Selwyn has proved himSelf a man of tenderneSs and delicacy—when my distrefe at the rooms was too obvious; not to strike the most common obServer '—He was Ib far from appearing to comment upon it, that he retired abruptly, as if the buSineSs, the apprehension, had been all his own.

your acquaintance--Sir Edward Sel-
wyn tells me he has already informed you of the unhappy condudt of his friend— he is pretty well recovered, indeed, but Seems to be extremely anxious to get him out of the country.
I cannot fay I understand the affair—• nor would I on any account betray what Lady Bindley might look upon as impertinent curiosity—But it is certain that her Ladyship has by Some means or other
been
ii6 LETT E R XXII.
been she occasion of the whole confusion ; and my lord’s behaviour is beyond mea^ Sure wild and unintelligible. A few moments before we were hurried from Bath, Sir Edward contrived to fee me— he was exceedingly diScompoSed at our abrupt departure, and to the last degree inquisitive reSpedting my Sister’s health— He must, my dear madam, be a very tender hearted gentleman, I am convinced, no leSs in this parting interview, than one or two former ones^ we had at the rooms: Yet I cannot help thinking it very extraordinary that he should So earnestly intreat me to Support, amuSe, and-comfort Lady Hindley—What deficiency or inattention can he have discovered in me ? I own I am rather hurt by the bare insinuation of my want of natural affedlion—but he is too well bred and too generous to offend any one intentir onally ; and as the cauSe of the little inconsistency wish his general charadfer, which I have taken notice of^ can be no more than siis over-abundant friendship for my sister," I ought not only to excuSe, but to honour him for it.
He
LETTER XXII. 117
/He begs that you would write to Lady Hindley, and Set the affair in the SoStest light imaginable; but it is his opinion that for the better concealment of the most dreadSulcircumstance, Some inferior ones should be communicated : But above all things he recommends the abSolute assurance of his having left the kingdom., as the grand effential to restore her peace.
I need Say no more to you, madam, on this head ; your own tendernels and discretion (to borrow Sir Edward’s ex-preshonS) will be your best instruftor; but it was necessary to give you his plan ; or I should not have preSumed to didtate to MiSs Harley.
What a strange turned mind Lord Hindley’s must be—He married my sister by the cruellest compulsion that ever Surely was pradtiSed—Yet would you believe it, madam, he is at times little better than a madman ; for ever more rendering her unhappy, when at home, by his teasing ways; and Sollowing her when in public, as if he apprehended he should loSe her, I can tell you, he was never much delighted with Sir Edward’s addressing her; tho’ he well knew how
old
iig LETTER XXII.
old an acquaintance he was of her ladyship’s, and could not deny his being a very agreeable gentleman. I thought his happineSs would have at least continued to the end, and shat she promotion of my sister’s would have been his incessant care, or I should not have borne to have Seen her Sacrificed even with the resolution I did; let whatever would have been the conSequence.
Noshing can be more pleaSant than the houSe v/e are now at—but if his lordship will not change his humour, w hat but miSery can be her portion ,? He will break her ladyship’s heart, and what would life be to me without her ? Ah! madam, iS Sir Edward Selwyn had but been my brother, how I should have , doaied on him; or even Mr. Hindley might have made my Sister very happy— but the aftion he has been guilty of, rather inclines me to give his Sriend the preSerence; for is it not Something of a piece with the unaccountable violence of his father.

When you have convinced yourSelf of the tye. that now Subsists between you, and duly weigh the unavailablenels and impropriety oS every SoSter consideration, you will find it no hard tash to confeis yourSelS his mother^ or breathe the sigh that is truly maternal.
But don’t be diScouraged, if this change is not altogether So easily effecsted as you could wish—Abfence, reflection, piety, and neceffity, will all contribute to aid the work v/hen once properly undertaken—We could hardly have flattered ourSelves that Such an affair could blow over with Ib little conSuSion ; and tho’,

Lady Hindley to ilfyj Harley,
There is Ibmeshing very extraordinary, my dear, in this Lord’s behaviour—He torments both himSelf and me, from exceSs of affedtion as he calls it—He found me once in tears—it was a flagrant offence—And another time, notwithstanding every diSagreeable circumstance, he happened to come into my dressing-room, when Patty had just called forth a transient Smile—nor do I know which occasioned him the greatest mortification.
He has never once mentioned his Son’s name to me, from what motives he can best tell—I am nevertheless much re^ sieved by your account of his having quitted England; for whether love or diSgust is the incitement, the conSequences may be equally happy to us both—Yes, my Harley, I can now Safely assure you the storm is quite laid—the matrimonial
yoke
L E T TER XXIV. 127
yoke properly assumed, and every rebellious inclination at rest; and you may hereaSter write of him, how and when ' you pleaSe—For to Spend my life with him was not half So essential to my Se^* Ikity, as to know him exempt from Suffering from any fault or misfortune of mine—We are very young, and'it is not impossible but we may one day meet the happiest of friends, tho’ we Should have proved the most wretched of lovers.
My Situation will certainly require peculiar nicety, to Secure me Srom many mortifications ill Suited to the delicacy of my nature. My Lord’s connexions, we are all lenSible, have been shch as can have given him no very favourable impressions of the Sex—but my condudf shall, if poshble, defeat the utmost malice of Suspicion; and command his reSpedf, tho'* his caprice should be un-Subdued.
The fweet Patty is beyond meaSure dejedted; at what she is unable to comprehend—^I'o have married me only to make me miserable, is a Species of gallantry she cannot enter into—and when i Speak encouragingly to her—she only F 4	weeps
128 LETTER XXIV.
weeps her Sister’s hard fate; and in Spite of all my chiding, will wish that Sir Edward Selwyn had been born for her brother in stead of So unaccountable an old gentleman.
There is to be a great stag hunt next week, in this country, as I shppoSe the papers have informed you; Lord Hind-ley has engaged himSelS—but he is stich a mifer.^ that perhaps he may prefer watching over his ill-gotten Jiore., to all the pleasures of the chaSe—I need not explain to you what I mean on this occasion.
I will take the opportunity of his ab-fence to write to you more largely on every Subjedt; for when I know him in the houSe, I cannot but be apprehensive that our correspondence is in danger of being interrupted—A circumstance too alarming not to teach me the utmost caution.
This place is a kind of palace—But what charms either its Situation or magnificence can have for my heart, I leave to you to pudge, v/ho are So well acqtninted v/irh its natural humility, and the poignance of its regrets.

I had hoped that a certain gentleman, whoSe stern behaviour had occasioned me So much terror, was an uncommon charader; unkind as he was, he had a great point to gain by ruining his daughter—A jail is a dreadful proSped, and a whole family would have been involved in the Same wretchedneSs—But Lord Hindley, what

I am far from wondering now at any thing that has happened—Mr. Hindley has strong Sensibility—and to be deprived of all, as he Says, oS all that he held dear in life, is too trying a circumstance to be patiently Submitted to.

Lord Hindley has had a Severe attack of the gout; Patty and I were as assiduous to divert and relieve his Sufferings as if he had been adtually dear to us—But we did not meet with altogether So grateful a return as we might haveexpedled— He has Sound out I am too fond of her, and complains bitterly that my affedion is all lavifiied on others, whilst he languishes in vain for the Smallest share of it.

I fied to my cloSet for shelter—but he purSued me thither with reproaches and inSults of the grossest and most aggravating nature.

‘ I thought he would have beat me—■ It is thus.

You have brought me, my Lord, under Such circumstances, that I wifli to have no other will than yours—Keys—-you will find you might have Ipared the grating demand—-I have not a drawer that is not open to your inSpedion ; and I am ready to be conveyed wherever you think proper ; you shall behold me undil-mayed, even when encountering the stern brow of an incenSed father.

Mary was called for—My Lord paid his compliments to her, and preSented me—‘ We are to continue Some time in London, madam. Said he, and lady Hindley will be peculiarly happy in hav-ing you Sor her constant companion.
Mary, Srom not understanding the nature of her trust, was by no means delighted with it—she could not, however, avoid condudling me to another apartment : and Sor the first afternoon did great violence to herSelf, in order to oblige Mr. MuSgrove and my Lord. But

We arrived at five in the morning—* My Sather received us in a parlour, and having very tenderly accuSed me with being the cauSe of Lord Hindley’s ill-nels—Said he would acquaint him that I had the grace to comply with his request.
Now I never till that moment heard that it was his request, but it was Sufficient for me to be inSormed oS his Sufferings, to draw me much Sarther than Srom London to his relieS—and the language oS unjust reproach was too Samiliar to my ear to strike very Sorcibly upon it.
He returned and bid me Sollow him. Lord Bindley, in a Seeble melancholy accent, begged me, the instant I entered his apartment, to be Seated dole by him.

He lay Some time without Speaking— the physician felt his pulSe, and told us his fever was vastly increaled.
He started up a few minutes afterwards in an actual delirium. Is the deed cancelled, MuSgrove, cried he ? Will she marry another ?—Ah, thou wretch—she

T T is an account of Lord Hindley’s .1. illneSs, my dear madam, my Sister
bids me preSent you with-but I must
take leave to make my Self of So much con Sequence, as to give you Some particulars relative to my affairs.
You cannot but recolledl the distressed circumstances under which I wrote rny last letter to you. What the conversation was between Lord Bindley and my Sister, on his return with me to the Grove, I am still ignorant, but the reSult was, that she was hurried aw^ay beSore my eyes, without my being permitted to Speak one adieu; and So Soon as another carriage could be got ready, I was informed by the ill-natured looking houSe-keeper, that
she
LETTER XLIIL ^19
she was to attend me to a ladies board-ing-School at Bologne.
You may be Sure, madam, I was greatly afflidted at this news—but it was in vain to resist, and we reached Dover that very evening. I found, however, that we were to proceed no Sarther without a letter from his lordship, or my father, and was beginning to ssatter my-SelS, when a man arrived and determined the whole affair at once—In a word, all miserable as I was, I was compelled to embark, remained for a whole month in no better nor v/orSe place than an aclual nunnery.
Well, I hope I shall never again experience the iiorrors the very idea of being shut up in a nunnery occasioned me—Sor 1 must own I had not the least doubt but that was to be the end of me —but when I had tormented mySelS half
sick---comes orders from Lord Hindley
to have me brought to Portsmouth, to meet him and my Sather on Some important buSineSs.
Mrs. Housekeeper instantly obeyed ; and after much Satigue, we arrived Some hours before the gentlemen—they were K 2	pleaSed
220 LETTER XLIII.
pleaSed to give me only a very cool reception ; lectured, examined me, but I held fast to my integrity, and I was sternly commanded by my father to prepare mySelS to make atonement for my breach oS duty. I would give all the world, my dear madam, to know what they had in their heads—but to my great mortification. Lord Hindley’s illneSs prevented their diScloSing their destgns, and doubt and apprehension are still my portion.
My Sather, you must know, never intended that 1 should have the pleasure, the happineSs oS being restored to my dear sister, nor would he even have let her know I was in the houSe—iS his lordship in a happy fit (I must call it) oS penitence, had not i ili'sted that I should be produced ; and he Vv'iil not admit of the fiightest contradiction.
But lord bleSs me! how wide have I run from the point—yet will you not excuSe me, as I really meant to oblige, instead oS wearying you—I may be vain ; but Such is the opinion I entertain of your goodnefs, that I cannot perfiiade mySelf you are indilferent to what concerns the
Sister
LETTER XLIII. 221 Sister oS your Sriend, especially aSter the striking instance you have been pleaSed to give me—And I now will endeavour to Suliil her ladyship’s intention with re-Spedt to Lord Hind ley.
We had not quitted his apartment five minutes, before we were reSummoned— His lordship was still in the Soft key of repentance and tendetneSs—He beSought my sister to Sorgive ail his harsh treatment oS her—and running over the particulars, she, by a general pardon, would have Spared him the vast expence of Ipirits he was at.
You exhaust yourSelf, my lord, Said she, and increaSe your disorder; stay till you are better—I have nothing to
complain of at preSent-----An unhappy
flight instantly Seized him—again diS-Sembling, cried he, you know you want my Son—have I not heard you wish Sor him ?—Do not your looks at this moment Speak your unworthy Sentiments ? You See his side bleeds, and would sty to . stop, to heal it—^Ah, again they meet, again I am the object of their contempt and ridicule—See Harry exults in my helpleSs condition—I will no longer lie K 3	here

here—hide me, hide me—they brave me to the very bed oS death—Must grove only is in my interest—they call him villain—they point at me—part them—drag her ladyship away—I will not thus be inSulted and tormented—fiie doats upon him—
Thus did he rave the greatest part of the day; either imagining that Harry had Seized lady Hindley, or was going to destroy himSelS—Both of which distresi fed him beyond description—and then the deed (whatever it is he means) disturbed him in leSs violent moments—that never perhaps did being paSs a more deplorable time.
I SuppoSe, madam. Said my father to lady Hindley, when we retired to Supper, you are now anticipating the joys of widowhood—but I would caution you not to be too Sanguine in your expeDati-ons. That you will posteSs many advantages, at most peculiar to yourSelf, I grant you,—youth, beauty, and a title, are flattering charms—but you will still find yourSelS dependant on your father— You may start—but be affured your Suture provision is as entirely at my
mercy

mercy as in your Single state—I am principal trustee to a very judicious Settlement, and will take care to See every tittle of it executed with the utmost punduality—You shall however, have no reaSon to complain, Eliza, unleSs it is your own Sauk.

Do you hear the inlolent, exclaimed he, but I will be calm—and yet—it is no matter, we shall Settle all hereafter.
Nothing more pasted in this interview; and Mr. MuSgrove (notwithstanding I well know he was greatly dilSatisfied with my sister and I being together) Sronn Some stroke oS policy we are unable to comprehend, has ever since continued the most complaisant of fathers.
Eler ladyship is of opinion you may venture to write to her; as Mr. Mul-grove can never think at this junOure, of attempting to~ intercept (if he was even to See) a letter with her Superscription—Indeed I have a notion he is afraid of provoking her, lest she should prevail on his lordship to malce Some favourable K 4	' alterations

I was inSormed of my uncle’s death before we even touched at the Madeiras —but I will conSeSs to you, not the fortune, the independence I had acquired, inSpired me with any great inclination to return to England, and yet the Indies was not the place I was the best affedted towards.
I quitted the merchant’s ship, and was taken on board a man of war; the first Lieutenant of which was one of our old
School fellows--We cruiSed along the

my own dear Eliza-----my mother, I
would Say.
I had too painfully experienced the impropriety of Surprises—I Sent for the boy, and Soon learned to my great astonishment, every circumstance oStheir buSineSs and Situation.
My father was aSlcep, and Mulgrove in his chamber—I ventured to write a note to my mother—who desired I should immediately be shewn into the parlour—^ and instead oS being shocked at my appearance, as I had Sondly apprehended, gave me the coldest and most mortiSying reception imaginable.
But in my conSuSion I forgot that I had beSought admission for a Sriend only of that Harry now before her; and Such was the alteration that dreSs, the Sun, and grief had produced in my peribn,
that
230 LETTER XLV. that she had not the most distant recol-ledion oS me.,. She mentioned me with a tenderneSs that cheated my Soul, acknowledged that she should be glad to See me in England, and Sighed when she bore testimony to the early commencement oS our acquaintance.
My heart beat in uniSon with her’s—■ and on regarding me more attentively, a starting tear or Some other characteristic of tender Sympathy, began to Suggest ^ shSpicion to her, that it was the exile him-SelS she was then in company with.
Is it possible. Said she, that you should be Mr, Hindley.?—Then I will not call mySelf unhappy—your preSence^—
1 bowed upon her hand, but as the reply I was going to make would not have been * altogether So conSormable to our characters as was requisite, I had the resolution to SuppreSs it.
She gave me all the difagreeable particulars oS the last twelve months oS her liSe, with an amiable SrankneSs—mentioned my Sather with compassion—an unhappineSs oS temper was alone the
cauSe oS his unkindneSs----She allowed
MuSgrove to be arbitrary and ambitious,
but
LETTER XLV. 231 but still in the moment oS that very acknowledgment—you, she proSeffed her-SelS much obliged to—her Sriend had been her great stipport, and as to my Self, her regard for my SaSety had cost her Some anxious hours.
I had strange agitations to contend with, but humanity, reaSon, and necessity enabled me to restrain them within tolerable bounds—Lord Hindley was in a condition to diSarm my rage—and MuS-grove the Sather of my Eliza—I therefore only reSolved to take an innocent revenge upon the latter, and rest the whole in peace.
My Sweet mother was now Sent for— she obeyed the Summons the instant she received it, but conjured me to remember what was due to raySelS and circumstances.
MuSgrove, with a lowering and coh-tradfed brow, entered the parlour—I a-roSe, paid him a compliment that he was in no degree entitled to, and reSumed my Seat.
The boy, apprehensive lest his Sather should treat me with too little refpedt, cried, papa—that is lord Hindley’s Ion.

You would not attempt to disturb him in his last moments
All SenSe oS injuries. Sir, is foreign to my breast—Such a period as this cannot fail to communicate very different Sen-Sations—let you and I but keep clear of animosities, and you will Soon be convinced, that to contribute to the composure, not the unnatural interruption of It, is the desire that governs and actuates my heart.

Be affured I accept your polite application as a very high compliment, and that I am not inSenSible to the merits of your friend ; but you must give me leave to explain mylelf upon the IIIbjeft, I hope no leSs to his, than your latisfadlion.
In the first place then, I must be allowed to acknowledge, that Second marriages were never what I approved—the tenet may be Singular, but it is fixed— I have my Sriendships, my attachments, liifficient to fill a more enlarged breast than I can boast; and cannot prevail upon my Self to graSp beyond Selicity.
I have, my Lord, attained a peaceful haven—and shall I not repoSe mySelf?— Storms and difficulties have hitherto Been my portion, and now that proSpedls are clearing upon me, and the Sweets of liberty court my enjoyment—can I expoSe my Self to the rough ocean oS life ?
I have not the least doubt of Sir Edward’s honour, humiaiiity, or love—His
whole
LETTER XLIX. 249
whole condudi has evinced his pretences to the former—and has he not conSeffed the latter ? But neither that honour, humanity, or love, would permit him to be happy in the union he Solicits—It is a difficult point Sor me to diScuSs ; as doing justice to his tender feelings might Seem a ressedion upon that memory, death has rendered Sacred.
I will therefore only add, that as
my friend----1 shall ever receive him
with joy; notwithstanding it would be impossible for me to behold him in another charader, without the utmost di-streSs and conSuSion.
I am, dear Sir, with due gratitude for your obliging Sentiments, your affedionate relation, '
Hindley.
You rejoice with me, Selwyn, and we will make the best we can of Edward.
He is ever entertaining me with the little Patty’s perSedions, and would you L 5	believe

I had devoted mySelS to eternal celibacy on the first knowledge oS my bitter disappointment, and had So long taught mySelS to Subsist on the conSoling hope, that her Ladyship would never enter into any new engagement, however early her opportunities; that it was depriving me of my last Support, consequently could not Sail to weigh me down with apprehension.
This Sweet Patty shall be Edward’s, all my acquisitions theirs—and I will Spend all the rest oS my days beneath their hoSpitable rooS—I never loved but once—nor is it possible Sor me to loSe, tho’ I can regulate the tender inclination —My mother and my Sriends shall divide my heart, and inSensibly wear out the Surrows anguish has thrown up in it.

To be Serious, my dear Lady Hindley, I will confcSs to you that my conversion was not So instantaneous as I have represented it. The continual assiduity and reSpeCi of a truly valuable man, was too striking a contrast to the cold Sir Edward, not to make a due impression in my breast—The one I Sound entitled to my esteem and gratitude, at the Same time that the other was in poffeshon (without rhime or realbn) oS my love. Every day brought me Sresh instances of the merit and increasing affedtion of the Sormer, and the mere Sriendly attentions of the latter—I was convinced, but not determined, until my little monitor came to my aid. Had I done justice to Mr. Selwyn’s behaviour, I am Satisfied you would have been charmed with it, and united your eloquence to his for the purpoSe he has So long had in view—but as I foreSaw, fo I guarded against my own happineSs; and tho’ honest conicience for ever reproached me

She is unquestionably a kind oS divinity on earth; and I, as well as Harry, must ever continue to adore her.
What was the wanton declaration I made in a Sormer epistle, when the meteor hope was dancing beSore my deluded eyes—that I should find but little difficulty
LETTER LII. 259
ty in transSerring my affedtion from her
ladyship to Patty---it was a baSe, a
punishable Salshood ; Patty, all lovely, accomplished, and attrading, is not my Eliza; nor is it more natural to me to breathe, than to breathe only for her.
And yet, my boy, I am So cloSely attacked on all sides, that I know not how to defend mySelf—Harry hinges all his felicity on this unthought of union— Lady Hindley declares it to me her earnest deSire; Mrs. MuSgrove tacitly entreats me to Save the worthy girl from ail Suture persecution ; and MuSgrove, either Srom a principle of SelS-interest, or shame, or both, is to the last degree Solicitous in promoting the univerSal wish.
Youth and innocence—how inexpressibly captivating—Why, why was not Harry’s heart open to their influence, and her ladyship’s principles lest rigidly delicate.? It will not be altered, nor can I shbmit—and what will be the consequence is impoffible to Say.
But 1 should have told you in what manner the worthy Mrs. MuSgrove received us. Lady Hindley, with Patty

in her hand, kneeled before the delighted parent—My children, my So recently lost children, cried she, how little could your mother have promiSed herSelS the felicity she now enjoys ! To behold your countenance, my Eliza, you, to whom I am indebted for every SatisSadlion of mySelf and family, once more composed—IS indeed to live—We will, my generous Sufferer, we will now loSe all disagreeable remembrances; and from this hour, will I endeavour to Sorget
mySelf---It is however, impossible,
Frederic, to give you an adequate idea of the tender Scene-—it was, in a word, the luxury of mental enjoyment, and the Sympathetic tear gave additional beauty to every eye. I began at last to be apprehensive of Ibme ill conSequen-ces to the mother, from her too strong agitations, and made an efibrt to detach her mind from its intenSe fatisfadlion; but she would be Seated between her two girls; and now her Eliza and now her Patty, was the objedt of her affedling endearments.
Mulgrove’s
LETTER LII. 261
Mulgrove’s top-fails are amazingly lowered, occasioned, as he tells the story, by the dying behaviour of his Sriend— I would not be ill-natured or uncharitable, but, if I remember right, he rather antedates his reformation'—the deprivation of power will work a more wonderSul change in a mean Soul, than any other circumstance—yet we will not examine him too minutely, but accept his Services and concessions, and leave his sincerity to be questioned or evinced, by the permanence of his good behaviour. O, but he gives you another rea-Son for his preSent gentleneSs, the disappointment of his expectations, with rdped to his favourite’s happineSs ; it was a match aSter his own heart, notwithstanding which, it turns out to his diffatisSaCSion; .and I really SuSpedt he feels a kind of conScious punishment in it, for his evil dealings towards our incomparable friend.
My heart, my Frederic, all this time finds no conSolation—Lady Hindley— Patty, Harry, alternately distreSs it—•
