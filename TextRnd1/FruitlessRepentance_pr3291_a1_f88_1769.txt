2 The History of
To view the venerable, the magnificent struDure; to contemplate the fate oS Poets, Kings, and Warriors, induced us to Spend Some time in the Sacred repository.
Having traverSed the iles, we naturally turned our eyes towards the choir: the prayers were just begun.
In that very moment a lovely figure shot by us into an adjacent pew; and exhibited a piDure oS what we before had only a very faint idea—beauty of holinef—down she knelt with the most becoming humility: her features, her deportment beSpoke the pious im-pulSe of her heart, and the incenSe of devotion aScended from her lips.
Struck with fo uncommon an objedt, we were unable to retire; yet a kind of reverence restrained us from inter-« rupting her by impertinent observation : we felt the awful conviDion of the propriety of her adorations: and while we
admired
Miss LEFEVER. 3
admired the fair, the finished creature, bowed lowly to the wonderful Creator.
Never was SaScination So grateSul; but it could not last; the Service concluded, we determined to follow her. She perceived, she blushed, she appeared embarrassed at our design, but to prevent the execution oS it was not in her power.
The little faint deScended, however, to play the hypocrite; Sor having traced her into a shop, she Sor Some time amuSed us with the notion that she was houSed : when, flipping out at a back door into a street that had a communication with the Park, most treacheroufly and ungenerouS-ly threw us out oS our chance.
Flow we raved, or rather I mySelS, George, Sor you was half domesticated even at that period, and your far-fetched reSpeD for your bride-ele6t, alone confined you from the Sallies of freedom.

The enSuing morning conveyed you from London, for a purpoSe, my friend, that perhaps by this time, you are most heartily weary of, and I commenced my literally wild-goofe chafe.

The Park, the Play-houfe, and the Church, divided my hours, but no light could be obtained, until the honest blundering GoddeSs, whom others So cruelly beSpatter, threw the blessing into ' ^ my very mouth, wshich, for a whole preceding fortnight, I had So fuccefsIeSsly Sought after.
My humble, but worthy relation, Mrs. I.eeSon, being a little indiSpoSed, Sent to beg the indulgence, as she called it, of one short interview. You are SenSibk I bscc her tne hiRhell: efceern, therelbre need not be told, that I waited upon hei immediately.
I found her with her Will lying before her ready witnessed, which she was desirous to lodge in my hands.
It cannot be extraordinary to you, my noble Friend, Said she, that at my time of day, I should consider every indiSpo-Sition, as a warning of my approaching dilSolution. Life has most incontestably proved its uncertainty, by the dropping B 3	off

I have, reSumed she, after a little pauSe, been taking a lesson of instruction this very morning. The moral page has for many weeks been Spread before me. A Lady Sinking under misfortunes, and struggling with diSeafe, is now in this houfe: she has not the means of procuring the requisites for her Support, nor is ic iii the power of an eminent Physician to relieve her Sufferings. Yet piety, resignation, patience, and confidence in that Being, that is able to bring strength out of weaknefs, have never once forfaken her ; what is a common departure at the fullneSs of age, to the miSery she experiences. Your heart, my Lord, is not devoid of Sensibility. Can you imagine i	any thing more beautifully affeCting than

head on the boSom of the tenderest and most endearing of children; who, forgetful of her own neceffities, has not a view or wish beyond affording her help or confolation. The pretty creature has left her but once this month, and then only went to afternoon prayers at the Abbey, and to breathe a mouthful of fresh air in the Park. I know not vrhat would have become of them, had they fallen into lefs humane hands.
My foul felt the alarm : it must he fo : it was the petition of filial tender-nefs, that engaged all her faculties, and the confcioufneSs of her poverty that incited her to sty from our inquisitive fight.
My countenance in Some degree betrayed the agitation I was thrown into, and good Mrs. LeeSon, from mistaking the caufe, beheld me with apparent approbation ; breaking out into a panegyric on the beauties of humanity.

It was my wish, it was my intention. Madam, cried I, eagerly catching at the pleasing intimation, will you condeScend to become my steward ? they would probably decline a favour from the young and gay; that your age. Sex, and cha-raXer would infallibly SanXiSy.
She received the gift, and extolled the giver : but all impreffions, Hendon, are , not sterling: I, indeed, compalsionate the unhappy, and would relieve the indigent, but to purchaSe the peace of Such a Sufferer, my liSe and fortune should be equally devoted.

Sir George Hendon to Lord Clerage.
Your Lordship’s vivacity will never forSake you : but allow me to remind you, that you was born for nobler purpoSes, than merely amusing yourSelf.
I recolleD the circumstance you mention : Subscribe to every article of the Lady’s lovelineSs, but utterly condemn your pursuit of her. Stop, I conjure you, and listen to the diflates of honour and humanity.
It was evident from her whole appearance, that she was not only the daughter, but the lover of chastity.
I have not fo entirely forgot the principles by which I formerly governed my-felf, but I will acknowledge, that a young fellow is, in Some degree, excuSable (thd* by no means justifiable) when accepting the bold challenges, or Softer invitations of the forward and the vain: but where neither B 6	tlie
I
12 The History of
the one nor the other is conSpicuous, it is not only. villainous to attempt, but darincr and inhuman.
O
I.ook into the streets, my Lord, rested upon the stews. Does infamy want a reinforcement ? And is not wretched-neSs already Sufficiently multiplied ?
But I will preSent you with a still cloSer and more pathetic argument.
The innocent deServing creature you have now cast your eye upon, is So peculiarly circumstanced, that it is impossible to deny her your tenderest compaS-sion. The iron-hand of poverty bears hard upon her. The tears of filial apprehension, to uSe your own expressions, yet bedew her cheeks. She is the only Support of her mother’s languishment, the only Source of conSolation that remains for her on this side the grave. Perhaps too, this worthy parent derives all her miSery from the unrelenting stroke of death; the hushand, father, the comfortable provision were fuddenly torn from her.
All
Miss L E F E V E R. 13
All theSe evils, my Lord, may nevertheless be shrmounted, unlels you can be Such a Barbarian, as to prove an impediment.
Virtue, the more it is afflifled, the more it is depressed, at length breaks Sorth with redoubled lustre; but the rough blasts of vice ; the fatal shaSts of ignominy, can deprive even pleaSure oS its charm, and affluence of its various gratification.
You and I oitght now to begin to aft the part of men ; the boy may be giddy, the youth idly, nay cruelly, gay; but the man should be Superior to both.
One principle operates pretty equally through the whole Species, Self-preServa-tion. Shall I destroy my neighbour’s peace, yet expeft to Secure my own? Shall I rob him of his dearest poffeffions, and no vengeful arm be stretched out to deprive me oS mine ?	•'
This morning’s Sun was witneSs to my union with a woman I have long

There are but few women of fashion that would not be propitious to your honourable addresses ; feleD her, my Cle-rage, you think best merits your regard, and give yourSelf an honest claim to the blessings of Society. But the preSent moment is all yx3u have to depend upon : the prejudice of education, the warmth of youth, and the witchcraft of vice, will prove too powerful for you, if once you behold her face again. She is an ornament to the creation ; an honour to her Sex. Spare her, therefore, as you wish tranquility to your own foul; for as Such an aftion could alone be perpetrated by the most infernal of monsters. So nothing leSs than the most infernal stings of conscience, would be the conSequence.

SuppoSe we just hear what the young woman has to Say upon the occasion.
Born to the happy inheritance oS health and chearSulneSs, and tenderly cherished by the best of parents, was not her infant state peculiarly blessed. Perhaps it might have bccii iiO diSadvantSgc to xicf to have passed her days in the silence of retreat: but where is the evil from whence good may not be extradled ?
Had she not breathed the however dangerous air of greatneSs, might she not have formed a falSe notion'^of its influence ? might she not have imbibed that vulgar error, that greatneSs is alone the walk of happineSs ? and fatally quarrelling with -the Substance, have purSued the empty shade.

Mrs. Le Fever’s relationship (tho’ I believe only in the fifth generation to I^a-, dy Catherine Oldham) was the primitive cauSe of her Ladyship’s attachment to her little name-Sake.
She indeed thought proper to fly out Somewhat extravagantly on the matrimo- ' nial tranSgreshon oS her cousin (though you youisielS must acknowledge that to marry a poor officer, the deScendant of a refus:ee, w^as a tranSgreffion of the most flagrant nature) neverthelefs, upon due. conceffions. and the birsh of thp. in question, she received the whole family once more into her gracious favour, and become doatingly fond of the last addition to it.
Kitty Le Fever was now about three years old, and in poffeffion of all thoSe winning arts that steal upon the tenderly difpoled, when her father’s regiment was ordered abroad.
Mrs.^ Le Fever (poor romantic foul, as Lady Catherine stiled her) was in the
bitterest
I

bitterest distreSs; her Iiushand, and her
child dividing her heart.

To Suffer the man she loved to encounter dangers or difficulties, she was unwilling to participate, was incompatible with her charaDer; and to diffuade him from his duty, too unworthy an attempt Sor her to engage in. Yet her Kitty, what must become oS her ? could She bear the Satigues of the Sea, and the ' -alarming effebds change of climate too frequently produce in the constitution, or with whom could she intrust So preci- ' ous a charge, if she could even prevail , upon herlelf and hufband to leave her behind.
I love to recolle61; the siist impressions I received of parental attention. Fler Ladyship would often relate the particulars of their departure as a winter’s-tale, and you must havT patience with my repetition of it, as tvell as many other circumstances that now Suggest themSelves in , my prelent melancholy humour.

2 2 The History o f
Lady Catherine took this opportunity to evince that her friendship was not merely proSeffional: she entertained the little Kitty during a Seven years Separation from thoSe near and dear relations with the utmost kindneSs, nor had she ever the ssis:htest reaSon to remember her Ms.
Mr. and Mrs Le Fever once more revisited their native country : but how shall I deScribe the raptures oS their daughter’s heart, when she embraced them : love and gratitude she had long been exerciSed in, but filial tenderneSs was an exertion of the Soul beyond what ever she had experienced.
Lady Catherine grew jealous, and Kitty was obliged to dissemble what it was impoffible for her to Seel, a Similar affection for her Ladyship, with that she bore her natural parents.
Her punishment, however, followed hard upon her crime. The regiment was again removed into the North, and as
Lady

M I s s L E FEVER. 23
Lady Catherine was unwilling to part with her favourite, she did not dare to propoSe leaving her: but languished out, many hours in Sorrow and mortification, which she was SuppoSed to employ in the greatest gaiety.
Another Seven years elapSed, when poor Mr. Le Fever—can I write it ?— poor Mr. Le Fever—in defending a fort, left his own family defenceleSs — he died upon the Spot—and I Survived to tell it.
My mother (for I can now no longer Speak in the Second perSon, drooped and deSponded. Lady Catherine pitied her — but pity alone was inSushcient to alleviate her affliclions.
Thirty pounds a year is certainly a Small pittance for two perSons to Subsist upon. I was nevertheless So unequal to beholding my motheHr’s declining state, without flying to her Support; that I uttered Some diffatisSaDory complaints against her Ladyship for wishing to detain me.

The provision she had made Sor me was noble, was greatly generous, but could not have preServed my dear mother’s liSe, and I chearSully Sorego it. Besides violent as her disposition is, might she not have afled. the lame part on any other provocation ? We will think no more oS it.

Besides, I am convinced you are the most unfit perSon on earth to struggle through life : you have too much generosity, too great condeScension : and will be ever falling a prey to low, cunning, and • little-minded deceit: thofe that cannot de-fcend to fufpicion, will ever be betrayed.

Captain Le Fever’s widovr should not be compelled to hide her head in a mean lodging, nor be reduced to accept the donations of charity.
Our Squire is upon the whole a good decent being; there was a time though, when Rome was Rome, my Kitty, that I would not have matched Captain Le Fever’s most accomplished daughter, with the best ’Squire of them all.

The old gentleman propoSed giving his daughter fourteen hundred pounds, upon the strength of which, and his own equivalent capital, the intended hushand was* admitted into a very advantageous partnership, and the wedding was to have been celebrated the enfuing week.
Instead of which happy event, besides' the lofs of an indulgent father, they had the affliflion to find upon a valuation of his effedls, that after Satisfying the creditors, there would not remain above five hundred pounds for each of the children.
The distrefs of the lovers, and in faff the whole family, is not to be defcribed.
The generous brother, however, hit upon an expedient to anfwer all their wishes (his mother and sister’s happineSs
being
M I s s L E F E V E R. 33
being dearer to him than his own, he mortgaged Mrs. Leceister’s jointure, or at least his reversion in it for a thouSand pounds, added the stipulated two hundred out of the miserable five, and paid it into the partners hands before any creature was even appriSed of his intention. He then obliged his mother and sister (as cash run very low with them) to accept an equal division of what remained : and having bestowed the one agreeable to her desires, and Seen the other comfortably Situated: with one hundred pounds in his pocket, and one of the best hearts in the kingdom in his boSom, he is coming to Lor don upon the recommendation of a friend or two to procure himSelf an humble curacy.
I am Satisfied you will entertain him kindly, as well on his own, as my account. He has great merit, and an en-gaging peision: but as his proSpeDs arc So unfavourable, your approbation of him must be tempered with discretion.

Mifs Le Fever to Mifs Winter.
My dear mother has been So Severely afflifled Sor this fortnight past, that it -was impossible for me to bestow a moments attention upon any other ob-je6t, however tenderly beloved.
Mrs. Stubbs, the good gentlewoman in whofe houSe we are situated, undertook to Send you a few lines, to prevent your mistaking the caufe of my Silence : I hope they have anSv/ered the desired purpol'e.
I have had much both to learn and unlearn at this trying period : the sine lady,
and
Miss LE FEVER. ' 35
and the uSeSul member oS Society are very opposite charaDers.
My prayers have been gracioussy accepted, my endeavours blessed to the utmost, and my dear mother is restored to me from the very verge of the grave.
Some little fatigues, Some anxious watchings will ever attend the bed of Sicknefs—but the weak, yet expressive pressure of the feeble hand —the gratefully intelligent langour of the uplifted eye— and the half articulate asslirances that our vigilance is foothincr to the beloved fuf-ferer, is more than ample compensation. My mother lives, my Polly: lives to thank her child for the offices, the assiduities she had a right to command, and you, who are all Sensibility and tender-neSs, can alone judge of my feelings.
She is now in a fweet ssumber : peace and Soft repoSe do not difdain to visit the humble roof. Lady Catharine, Lady Catharine, I hope they have not fled from ' you to us.

But this moment is my ov/ri: my mo-^, ther is happy; and I will be playSul:	'
move on, therefore, my pen, with unuSual rapidity; for I have much to communicate by thy means, to the heart of my friend. I will, in the first place, however, Speak to the principal SubjeD of your letter.	^
, And is there no other alternative ? accept your propoSal, or forfeit your attachment ! Then thus we break hands ! and conSign every remembrance of our long-continued friendship to oblivion!
O Polly, Polly, how strangely are you deceived in your prefent calculation ?
You fee the tremendous charaDers above written, are no blacker than the rest ; nor should they prove offensive to your sight, would they be more difficult to eraSe ? but, be assured, that thole that are traced out in the Soul, are of So different a nature, that though they may be -painSullv retained, they are indelible.
Friend-
Miss L E FEVER. 37
Friendship, like love, is not free Srom Some little excesses and inconsistences. A most eligible Scheme, truly, have you planned : turn thief, for your friend, and reduce her to the criminal standard of a receiver oS stolen goods.
I must have the Superiority, I find : at preSent, if we let you tell the story, you are a mere pigmy to me in goodneSs: and was I capable of accepting your kindly intended (though, certainly, most romantic, offer) it is pretty evident on which side the balance v/ould incline.
I think I can affirm, that, as far as your aftual property extended, I would not Scruple to be obliged : but you must not over-reach yourSelf.
Besides we are not So destitute of the jneans of Subsistence, as you imagine : a twenty pound Bank-note was conveyed to us by the Penny-post, in the hour of our greatest need, but where to place the obligation, we are utterly ignorant.
I had
g8 The History of
I had many noble Sriends ; but I concluded that all was at an end between them and me, when I withdrew rnySelf, though on So justifiable, nay So indiSpen-fible an occasion, from my once tender beneSa6lreSs. O had she but been either uniSormly cruel, or uniformly kind, my heart had been Spared the acutest pangs.
'	I intended to have laughed with you,
or rather at you, by placing your honest generous propoSal in a just point of view : but SeriouSneSs has Seized the reign, and resteSlion will have its hour.
Once more I am yours.
I cannot enter upon the tender Subjefl; relative to that high claim, to consideration you So warmly impute to my mother and me. It is, my dear, in more reSpeDs than one, a truly tender SubjeD.
But to Silence you in an essential degree, turn your eyes to Lady Catherine Oldham. From her I might have ex-peDed a mitigation of the too common Sate of the field. She is not Surrounded by
num-
Miss LE FEVER., 39
ntimberleSs Solicitations ; she is not liable ' to be impoSed upon by SalSe reports : nor is she inSensible oS the disqualification I have derived immediately Srom her indulgence, to Sustain the calamities, to which she has both driven and abandoned me.
You must not, thus, my dear Polly, enervate the mind that is already too weak, by theSe heart-wounding Sug-. gestions.
I am again unable to proSecute my design : and it is your fault, at this moment, that I experience the Sull recollection of all my misfortunes.
I must chide you for once SuSpefling that a change of circumstances can have produced So unworthy a change in my Sentiments, as to prompt me to accept of a man (if he had an opportunity, and was inclined to offer himSelf) that you would ever have hesitated to prcpoSe to me.
Matrimony is an affair, that I have hitherto bestowed but little attention upon
40 The History of
on: the men, or at least the generality oS all thoSe I have ever yet been acquainted with, kindly furnishing me with a strong antidote to approving them; for they have been pleaSed to find me So fair, that they have treated me like a fool.
I have, this day however, been cast a Second time, in the way of a young gentleman, that vouchsafes to converge with me in the stile of nature and common-SenSe. There is a polite eaSe, yet a pleasing rusticity, if I may So expreSs mySelf, in his figure and deportment: and I own his addreSs is particularly agreeable to me. Perhaps it may not be difficult for you to gueSs the man.
I thought you had been better acquainted \v ith human-nature, than to ex-peD discretion in a girl of eighteen. You largely commend the bearer of your much valued letter, yet would preScribe the narrowest limits to my approbation of him.
’Ought
Miss LE FEVER. 41
Ought you not to have'considered how unfit the SeaSon of Sorrow and SoftneSs to resist tender impressions.
The first tirrje Mr. Leceister came to our lodgshgs, he was shewn into the dining-room, before I was even appiifed of his arrival.
He told Mr. Stubbs’s Servant that he brought a letter from one MiSs Winter, which she had enjoined him to deliver into no one’s hands, but her friend MiSs . Le Fever’s.
I would not pay fo ill a compliment to your injunsilions, as not to comply with them ; but my features were disordered, and my 'dreSs exceptionable ; my mother’s alarming condition, had called forth many tears, and my heart was replete with unutterable affliftion.
I appeared before him: his countenance beSpoke the humanity of his nature.
1 had no conception, Madam, Said he, that my visit was lo ill-timed, I have lonsc been a near neighbour of MiSs tVin-
ter’s
42 The History of

The best of mother s, Sir, returned I, in the best manner I was able, I am upon the point oS being Separated from the most valuable of mothers. You will excuSe my reception of you : the preSent vou bring me intitles you to every civili-,	ty in my power. I have not been able
myfelf, to make my friend privy to my iiiiSerable apprehensions : but she knows them by this time from another hand, since you left the country, perhaps.
He faithSully promiSed to let me See him at Some other period; and leSt me with apparent commiSeration.
I have been lately informed that not one day passed without his applying to the Servant for intelligence concerning us : and he no Sooner learnt that my mother was out of danger, than he Sent in his name, and best congratulations: and be-
fore
Miss LE FEVER. 43
fore the end oS the week made a perfonal presentation oS them with great politeneSs.
I believe he staid near two whole hours : his converSation was pleasing and judicious : no lightneSs, no silly adulation ; upon my word I have not been So agreeably entertained, since I converSed with yourSelS.
But he is not rich, you Say, and, therefore, I am to keep discretion for ever in view : and what have riches to do, I be-feech you, with the peision, disposition, or understanding. He is a gentleman by his proSeshon : and the fewer favours he can boast from fortune, the more Suitable acquaintance he is for me.
I own my education has rendered me fomewhat nice in the choice of my company. The goffip's tale, rude mirth, or noiSy ignorance, would strike harfh upon my ear. But ife cannot be necessary for me to endure Such violences. Women in a private situation have it always in their power, at least, to be alone : and
Some
44 The History OF
Some Small industry in conjunDion with the humble certainty we are poffeffed of, may Support us at once above want and meanneSs.
We are extremely happy in one particular. An old Sriend oS Mrs, Stubb’s, a Lady of family and fortune, has for theSe eighteen years past occupied the first , apartments in her houSe. You cannot imagine the IdndneSs she has shewn us. She has Srequently relieved my watchings in the day time, and Surnished us with many comSortable articles : nor should I have been able to devote even a single half hour to Mr. Leceister, notwithstanding all his civility, if she hadnotcondeScend-ed to Supply my place as head niiisie.
Two gentlemen have already pretended that obtaining the favour of my hand was their highest ambition. I must beware of the third. The merits of your friend, Polly, are almost irresistible.
The first was much older than myfelf, illiterate, yet vain of his own endowments.
The
Miss LE FEVER. 45
The Second, as unexceptionable as the generality oShis Sex, but my heart would never incline towards him.
Lady Catherine very willingly admitted my objeDions to the one, nor once condemned my indifference for the other. But the truth was, she loved herSelf better than either of them, and did not wish to part with me.
Should Mr. Leceister be diSpoSed to make the third, where would now be the impediment ? Would not his behaviour, as a child and brother, be an undeniable Security for his behaviour as a hushand ; you need not, however, apprehend any danger from our connexion: I can diS-
O
tinguish, I vrill approve his worth ; but my mind is too equal to experience the violence of any paffion.
Take this memorandum along with you, Mrs. Mary, though, that you yourfelf have cast the Snare, and if I should happen to be unfortunately en-/	tangled,

0H0! have I then lashed you into repentance ? ’tis well: and you shall find I can be gracious : nor will I Suffer my wrath to out-live your provoking Spirit.
I begin to think that curiosity is not only born with us, but that it is the last Surviving passion of our nature.
Levity, vanity, Solly, the Small portion, I mean, George, that you possessed oS each of them, bled on your marriage-altar.
You who a few months ago vras quite as ready as your friend, to head a frolic (provided it had the reputation of being a harmlefs one) instantly upon your reconciling yourfelf to Hymen, wage your pen against every Species of gallantry : yet are the inquisitive impulfes of your foul apparently unSubdued.

Continue to entertain you, is your modest demand, with the exertion of my lively humour : or in other words, you cannot SuppreSs your desire of being informed of my flights and fancies, from a double motive; first, that }mu have naturally an itching ear after my wrong-headed, rattling concerns ; and, Secondly, that it is the only means of your picking up fresh matter of condemnation, with re-SpeGb to my condu6f and principles. Is not this the fadf ? and yet, as your extravagant demand happens to correspond with my own inclination, it shall be complied with : for I must confeSs, that my difcoveries (and I have made Such as wist astonish you, or you are not the fellow I take you for) are but half enjoyed when ' uncommunicated.
You have heard of Captain Le Fever, how bravely he fell, in defending a foit in the North. This fly deceiver, this all lovely Girl, this honour to her own Sex	^
(your epithet) and bane of ours (mine D	George,
50 The History or
George, every man in his way, you know) is no other than his unfortunate daughter. How many difficulties did he not cope with ? but we will not disturb his worthy ashes. A glorious death terminated a valuable life; and the best monument we can ere6l to his memory, is to preferve his precious remains from perish-ing.
I wish you could fee my heart at this moment, undeformed by vicious hopes, and wholly intent upon restoring this fallen family to their proper condition.
I must have an interview with her. I must be indulged, as good Mrs. Leefon phrafes it, with one half hour’s conversation. I may Surely preSume to admire her (though I confeSs I have no intention, at preSent, to make a Sacrifice of my hberty) do not burst out upon me with Such violence : is there no medium then? matrimony or feduDion will necessarily be the coni’equence of our meeting: be it So : for, whatever enSues, I will not
compel
/
Miss LE FEVER. 51
compel mySelf to forego my flattering resolution.
I perceived there was Something uncommonly genteel in her; the Simpleton, to conceive that a plain dreSs, which is the best ornament of a beautiful woman, would in any degree conceal her perfeflions: but it is impossible for you to have any idea of the hard terms on which I am to obtain my introduDion : nothing in nature was ever more unreasonable.
They have taken a lodging in the country, and I am required patiently to wait for their return to town, before I have the pleafure of becoming acquainted with them. “ Mrs. Le Fevefs Spirits are too weak to admit of the company of strangers, and a month or six weeks will Soon paSs away.”
W^hen people come to be married, George, or arrive at the ancient period Mrs. LeeSon has attained, how Sagely, how calmly do they judge of things ; but it is no eaSy talk in the heyday of the D 2	blood
52 The History of
blood to Subscribe to Such mortiSying Sentiments : yet this is not only required of your friend, but he must alfo restrain bimSelf from every appearance of diSatiS-faftion; lest the good old Lady should take alarm, and for ever exclude him as dangerous perSon.
1 remember to have Seen the Sweet Girl with that flinty hearted Lady Catherine before 1; went abroad, but she was a mere child then.
What a violent and revengeSul disposition her delicate Ladyship poffeffes ! she is not to be intreated : She brought her up from her earliest infancy; Spared no expence in her education; careffed, encouraged, proteDed her, until this ciitical junflure, hah! Hendon, when she has thrown her upon a wide, ungenerous, unpitying world ; and under circumstances too, that any man, besides mySelf, would rejoice in.
But no, MiSs Le Fever, your father’s blood shall not be shed in vain : it was in

my deSence he fought, it was my property he Secured Srom the enemy’s graSp : he has procured me eaSe and tranquility, and his darling child shall find a sheltering roof.
Thus every member of the community ouRht to consider thoSe who died to defeat the attempts of the invader; and the greater the benefit, the greater the tye.
Had she been any other female, you , might have trembled for her Safety, but poor, honest, b^a^T Le Fever’s daughter shall find her Security in lier very name.

meaStire restored, and Smiling peace once more begins to dawn upon us.
We are now at Kensington for the air, and I do assure you Mr. I.eceister is our constant visitant; I l eally SuSpeD, to deal fairly by you, that he is Some few degrees more friendly than I could wish.
My mother expresses her good liking of him, in the highest terms : “ So modest, “ So sincere : believe me, Kitty, he is no “ common chaiafter: and as thoSe poS-Seffions are leSs frequent. So they ought “ to be the more abundantly cultivated “ in a maSculine breast.”
But do not conclude that I am absolutely taken in : I indeed like him better than any other perSon I have yet met with for many reafons; though by no means in love with him, I do assure you.
Mrs. Leefon has done us the favour to look in upon us many times ; she is a charming woman : I hope there are many fuch for the fake of other unfortunate families; for I am not of that number who conceive themfelves marked out for . , peculiar vengeance.	Afflic-
Miss L E F E V E R. 55
AffliDions and disappointments are the ' general lot oS humanity : yet there are Sew that have not many things to be thankSul for, tho’ they may have many to be diSatissied with : and thoSe who complain So loudly of an unequal distribution of good and evil, do not properly attend to the various changes, and wonderful turns ' life affords.
If Mr. Leceister should be So simple : but he can never intend Such a thing, his circumstances are almost as limitted as my own; and I have been too well-hred to be capable of making a notable wife.
I will, however, hide nothing from you, he has, my dear, been very particular marry times, and I have this afternoon engaged myfelf to walk with him into the gardens.
Shall I trust myfelf ? it is an enchanting Spot; a Second Arcadia; and may, too probably, contribute to harmonize our Souls. Love is the offspring of Soft delight; and I think I will not rashly D 4	tempt
5si T HE H I S T o R Y O F
tempt my fate : yet how strange to re-traO from my word.
He is come my Polly, and claim^s my promiSe, nor can I wish to be excuSed Sulsilling it.
It was not vanity, my dear Girl, but well-grounded apprehension that would have restrained my giddy steps. Yet the declaration was neither engendered by that incident, nor would have been much longer Suppressed, if that had been totally avoided.
I cannot look back to my own foolish behaviour, without mortification: nor forward to the profpeDs that now break in upon me without diSmay. The loves, the graces, the little dimpling Cupids have nothing to do with poverty : and who but the abSurd or frantic ever lacrifice to a pennylefs Hymen.
I know not what I Said, I was So utterly confounded, but I fancy my countenance was not very diScouraging.
There
Miss L E F E V E R. 57
There cannot, however, be any harm in the acquaintance: for as to the ' bare mention of matrimony, it must be far enough distant.
There is a romantic generosity, an extravagant portion of Sensibility, as you once observed, in my composition, that will be my bane. But I could not bear to torture a worthy heart; nor could I ever accept a haughty hand.
The generality of mankind are too narrow in, their Sentiments for me to chuSe to owe them an obligation : and though I am not for a hovel, yet a bare competence, and the man I love, would be my highest ambition. Mr. Leceisters education is unexceptionable: my pride' is, in every refpedl, gratified: his perfon is agreeable; his manner engaging; and I do SaSpefl; we were born for each other, unlefs you can have the cruelty to forbid the banns,

I want prodigioussy, my dear Mrs. Lee-Son, Said I, one afternoon, to See Mrs. Le Fever: she must be an amazing woman to Sustain the shocks of adversity, and the anguish of difeafe in the manner she has done.	' '
Indeed, Sir, returned the old Lady, there is no describing the merit of her charafler:
I shall take great pleafure in introducing you the first opportunity, and as she will be ignorant of your rank, you will most certainly converfe with her to infinite adv^antage.
And her daughter, my dear Madam, rejoined I, Somewhat ssyly, we must not forget her: 1 SuppoSe neither her personal nor intelleflual perSeDions are yet in their full maturity ; but she promiSes, I
think
62 The History OF
think you fay, not to be unworthy of Such a mother.
You never, my Lord, returned she, beheld So compleat a creature: I tremble for her future fate : extraordinary merit and extraordinary beauty are ever most unmercifully taxed by an envious world. Providence has, it is true, bestowed a double portion of prudence upon her: but if she happily avoids the Snares of vicious and designing men, what can Secure her from the little malice of thofe women she So strikingly excels ? I know not how she can diSpofe of herfelf: but we ought not to anticipate misfortunes: the hand that formed her what she is, can at all times proteD her.
Why, Hendon, cannot you and I become, what we must esteem. Charity and religion can be made to sit every shape. But I beg your pardon ; you are at this very writing, what I, (wretched hypocrite, that I am) only preferve the appearance of, and our rewards and punishments

ttishments will be proportioned to our deSerts.
What can poffeSs me to harraSs my miserable brain So intolerably about a Girl I have no acquaintance with : for that very reaSon, George, you understand the infatuation, and I need explain myfelf no farther.
It is the misfortune of us Lords to be too Successful in our attacks : there, is magic in the very name, I believe, to every one but the party that bears it. Their little hearts do So palpitate when his LorL Jhip vouchsafes to admire them, though his views are leSs worthy in general, and his appetites more groSs than his stable-keepers. '
A man of education is an unequal encounter for an illiterate Girl: a hand-Some figure is flattering, and a large fortune a powerful persuasive : but the uninformed, the weak or mercenary huffy, would not do for me.

Letter XI.
Le Fever to Mijs Winter,
HOW can you, my dear Polly, fie So Surprized and mortified at the connexion between Mr. Leceister and me ? Was he not the very man to Succeed with a woman of my diSpofition ; can you desire I should attain a higher eminence than happineSs ? and, believe me, if it is any where to be found, it is in the humblest state of independence : just above the frowns of poverty, and infinitely beneath the deceitful Smiles of Splendor and affluence. But you intreat what you call the disagreeable particulars.
I in-
Miss LE FEVER. 65
I inSornied you oS our conversation in the Gardens: that is, I confessed he had made a tender declaration of his affeftion, and you might gueSs the rest : the language oS lovers is pretty general. We returned home to tea; Supped together^ and, it Seems, he did not go to London until the next morning.
For Several Succeeding days he repeated his visits with the utmost pundluality. My mother was not to be impoSed upon ; she examined me touching his proSeS-Sions, and I did not deceive her.
My dear child. Said she, it gives me great pleaSure to find you So frank and ingenuous : I can have no objeDion to the young gentleman, if he is able to provide for you : but you have been too delicately bred to encounter the miSery of contraDed circumstances. It is a formidable step, and requires deliberation. If you could even depend upon passing Some Sew years without a family, the hazard would be leSs alanning: but it is the natural
66 The History of
tural conSequence oS the state, and must not be left out of the calculation. How far, my love, continued she, would a curacy go, in Supporting four or five per-fons, and how rniSerable would your re-steDions be, when the evil was irremediable ? It is my duty to make you Sensible of thefe particulars, but depend upon it, your happinefs will always be the grand objeD of my attention; and your own feelings and discretion must point out to me, the most effeDual means of promoting it.
Dear Madam, cried I, greatly affeOed by her tenderneSs and goodnefs, you must not deliver up your child to the regulation of her own weak fancy : you must restrain, you must instruD her upon every trying occasion : and if errors are to be her portion, let them be the errors of duty. I own I approve Mr. Leceister ; but, as to matrimony, neither him nor my Self, can, at preSent, have any idea of it; we are very young; our acquaintance
with

with each other, may not be in any de- ^ gree disadvantageous, as I have not a wish to recommend mySelf to any other per-fon. Nor is it impossible that this beginning friendship may, on his part, early decline: many things that delight us on a first view, loSe their estimation on being familiarized. He has had, as yet, but few opportunities of conversing with me ; I could, therefore, be glad if you would So far indulge me, as not to appear fenSible of our connexion, unlefs it should be more strongly confirmed; as your not ' making yourlelf a party, would enable the. young gentleman to make a more decent retreat on any diSgust, or fickle inclination.
I am rather concerned than pleaSed at his eleDion of me, though there is not, oer-. haps, a man living that would have been So eligible to me, from many peculiarities in his taste and circumstances.
My mother, my dear Polly, kindly kissed my cheek, wiped off a falling tear that eScaped me involuntarily, and blessing her
poor,
68 The History of
poor, her reduced girl, left her to recol-leO herSelf without interruption.
And what do you think w'as the reSult ? what is very uncommon, I believe, in caSes oS this nature. I wept to find that what I had expeDed, nay had been bold enough to hope for, was aflually come to pals : but I do not know how it was ; it Seemed like tearing my dear mother from my boSom, to make room for a foreign guest. In short, it was the folly of childish-neSs, and the workings of simplicity. Thus I, who a few weeks ago was free as air, had no wish beyond the restoration of rny mother’s health, nor view but the promotion of her happineSsj have now given ‘ my heart to a stranger, and more than half refolved in due time, to become a dutiful wife.
This duty, however, must never interfere with that I bear another darling ob-jeO ; Mr. Leicester shall, at least, appear to entertain the lame tender consideration for my mother, I hatT ever done : and
our
Miss LE FEVER 69
our mutual endeavours shall be exerciSed to Soften her cares, and enhance her enjoyments. Nor will the lesson be hard to him, that has already given Such strong and amiable proofs of filial and fraternal regard. Ah Polly, iS you would have fc-cured me from this interestinsf attachment, you should not have given me thoSe recommendatory strokes : Such charaDers, as my mother justly obServes, are from their fcarcenefs highly estimable.
Disappointments and adversity are excellent School-masters : with reSpeft to all thoSe little grateful attentions, my dear mother stands in need of: it is Suffering alone, that teaches us to feel, except, indeed, in Some extraordinary compositions, where the whole Soul is, as it were, har-mqnized, and replete with the most gentle Sensibilities.
Under Such auSpices, what could we fear : that bug-bear poverty conSecrated by the maternal benedi61ion would loSe its terrors; and we should be convinced
Py
yo The History OF
by the pleasing evidences of our owit fenSes,'how moderate the demands of nature, and in how Small a compaSs the real necessaries oS liSe are comprehended.
Perhaps you will call this mere heroiSm; Nor will I be too poSitive of the contrary: but you must allow that, at leash distant dangers are not very alarming: he has Some Sew friends to recommend and Support him; and, in all probability, long before an union can Serioussy be thought of between us, he may be enabled to make a fuitable provision for me, to the humility of my fortune, expeDation, and wishes.
He is to leave London the day before we return to it, to give his relations the meeting at Birmingham upon Some busi-neSs of conSequence to their affairs : and I flatter myfelf that I shall be comfortably fettled in Some little employment before he revisits us. Never start, my Girl, it is the birth-right of the poor daughters of the Church and Army : only join with me in lamenting that their education

C. Le Fever. Letter XII.
Lo7‘d Clerage to Sir George Hendon.
Am I not a clever fellow, George, to carry every point my heart is Set
upon,
The morning arrived that was to com^ pleat my utmost desire, I could no longer restrain mySelS, but dropped in, as if Srom Sudden recolleSlion, upon Mrs. Lee-Son, who was Smirking with an inferior (though, perhaps, more worthy) joy, Srom the Same cauSe, for she had long sighed for a re-union with her friends.
SuppoSe, Madam, laid I, as it is a very sine day, we were to take a little airing: Mrs. Le Fever cannot come to town without^ carriage, and her expences must
have
72	T II E II I S T O R Y O F
have run So high during her illneSs, that it is too probable, it may not be very convenient for her to procure Such neceS-Sary accommodations ; we might take them up in our way, and confer the trifling favour without woundincr their nice fensibi-
O
lity.
I listen to you, my Lord, I behold you with admiration, exclaimed the good old Lady : theSe delicate, thefe generous attentions to the feelings of the unfortunate, are Sweet and amiable emanations of benevolence. It is not Sufficient that we relieve the necessitous, but we should Suit ■	our benefaSlion to the state, condition,
and capacity of the objeD, lest while we assist their poverty, we deprefs their Souls. Far be it from me to oppoSe the execution of your noble wish : we will go, my young friend, and immediately if you pleaSe.
It was not for me, you know, to disapprove of whatever So venerable a gentlewoman condescended to propoSe. A
coach
Miss LE FEVER. 73
coach was Sent Sor; and "she retired for a few moments to her cloSet, to thank heaven, perhaps, that So well-diSpoSed a youth existed, as her cousin Clerage.
Well: we ought all oS us to be as good as we can: and the best—it is a fearful refleDion though, for Such Sorry varlets as you and I, George : for if the best must remain a remove or two from perfeDion, what can be Said for—but I forget your late reformation of manners and principles, and that I am following your example with all possible expedition.
My drefs was plain, and as my features can assiime a decent cast upon occasion (did I ever give you a Specimen ?) I was not without hopes that Mifs Le Fever would be unable to detefl me for the giddy fellow that traced her from the Abbey. Nor did my good genius fail me in So essential a particular. Mr. Smith passed current for a Sober country gentle-E	man,
74 TheHistorvof
man, and I could perceive that Mrs. Le Fever eyed him with approbation.
The sty Girl was peisieDly herfelS: my figure, my addrest, they may not be striking, Sir George, but you must allow me to Say, they are not the most exceptionable you ever met with. MiSs Le Fever, however, was no more affeDed by either the one, or the other, than if I had been a plough-boy.
She has been told, I SuppoSe, that lan-\ guishment becomes her : she fighed once or twice proSoundly, her lovely face lost its vivacity, and never was tender Sorrow more pathetically expressed.
But what can she now have to disturb her ? is not her mother's health restored ? is she not returning to a houSe where every one is prepared to adore her : the cauSe, George, is Sufficiently obvious : her strongest apprehensions removed, she has iciSure to resseD upon her own miSerable circumstances, and the pleaSures she enjoyed in her day of Splendor.
Com-
Miss LE FEVER. 75
CompoSe, thou daughter oS poor Le Fever, compoSe thy every anxiety: Lord Clerage’s Sortune is much Superior to the haughty the revengeSul Lady Catherine’s ; whatever it is capable of purchasing, or whatever good offices its master can perform, you may and shall command.
Mrs. LeeSon ordered coffee tobe brought Srom a proper houSe, the young Lady was called upon to preside at the little ceremony, and I insisted upon being the only attendant.
Mrs. LeeSon had the honor to receive her cup from my hands, but who can deScribe my happineSs in receiving it from MiSs Le Fever’s. Her singers are delicately turned, her nails tinged v/ith the Softest red : yet has she no idea of displaying them to advantage, nor should I by any other than this accidental means have discovered half their lovelineSs.
Never was knave more circumSpeist; than raySelf, lest the good Mrs. LeeSon ffiould find me tardy. Your elderly E 2	Ladies
y6 The History or
Ladies, in general, are very shrewd observers ; but I may thank the honesty of her own heart for Securing me from SuS-picion.
When once one accustoms oneSelf to an idle rattling way of writing, it is not easily renounced : but let this, Mrs. Lee-Son, penetrate the inmost recesses of my foul, I can assure you, Sir George Hendon, that even your own in its preSent reSormed state, could not better Sustain the cloSe examination. Compaffion, tender regard, and no other the most latent inclination, would be discovered through all its foldings. But SuppoSe we proceed to town. Our coffee diSpatched, and our carriage at the door, I offered my hand to Mrs. LeeSon, as standing most in need of my assistance. I am Sorry, Ladies, Says I, that I can Serve but one of you : they Smiled, curteSied, and followed us.
When we reached the coach however, we made a kind of halt; ceremony is odious, but little tokens of refpeftful consideration cannot be difpenfed with, especially
Miss L E FEVER. 77
dally where Srom diSparity of fortune they are liable to miSconstru6lion. Mrs. Le Fever was too well-bred to be trouble-Some, and we Soon drove off in high good humour.
MiSs Le Fever’s youth, and my Sex, cast us upon the Same Seat: attradion is not to be resisted : my heart strongly inclined, my eyes involuntarily turned towards this powerful objed, I, neverthelefs, con-duded myfelf with the prudence, the refolution of an anchorite.
With what different feelings, Said the good Girl, do I quit this place, to thoSt; I experienced on my arrival at it, and the Salutary effed the air has had upon my mother’s constitution, will ever endear the name of Kensington to my heart.
Flappy Kensington, cried my too stip-pant tongue, to be fo fweetly commemorated : I, indeed, must forget myfelf, when I fail to remember that it was at Kensington that I attained the most interesting of my wishes; and its double E 3	merit,
78 The History of
merit, shall have double weight in my estimation.
Luckily Mrs. LceSon and Mrs. Le. Fever were engaged upon an important fubjedl, or the warmth of my accent, no leSs than the expression oS my countenance, must have betrayed me : for it was the workings of nature, and the faculties, you know, will be obedient.
What are hours, days, years, in company with thoSe we love : our little excursion was terminated almost in the in-, stant of its commencement: Mount-Street, Berkley-Square is So trifling a distance from Hyde-Park, as not to be worth mentioning.
O
An humble repast was provided by Airs. LeeSon about two o’clock, alias a dinner : but would you believe it, that little witch refuSed to participate it: she had two very long letters to write, and begged the indulgence of having a plate Sent up to her own apartment.
What
Ml ss L E F E V E R 79
' What can be the meaning, Hendon, that we fellows, instead oS being diSgust-ed by Such whims, are rather doubly attached ? Was it instiiiH in this Chit, think you, in order to torture me, or was it simplicity ? it is as impoffible for me to discover the real motive, as to Secure mySelf from being tormented by it. And So far was I from repaying negledl with negledl, that I found mySelf more than ever dessrous to cultivate her acquaintance, and recommend mySelf to her favor.
Have I not already Suffered a martyrdom for her fake, in tete-a-tetes with my elderly relation : but judge what a pretty figure I made this evening at whist, with a triumvirate of the Same brilliant stamp.
Mrs. Le Fever, has, indeed, the remains oS a very sine face: but astliDion, sicknefs, and the revolutions of time have left distindl tokens in each ravaged feature.
Mrs. Leefon’s countenance, though almost. double Mrs. Le Fever’s age, has-E 4	many

many beauties, yet grief and a long shc-ceffion oS periods, have made no inconsiderable attempts to deprive her oS every charm; but an excellent constitution, amazing strength of mind, a naturally contented Spirit, and an eaSy fortune, have been powerSul opponents; and Secured that ever venerable, and pleasing aSpe6S from even thoSe devastations, the poor um happy Mrs. Le Fever’s has experienced.
But the third Lady is of a quite different Species. A dark complexion, strong lines, and unpleaSant brow, are the unfavourable covering of a most valuable mind ; to esteem her, you must be ac- ' quainted with her disposition and character, and thoSe once known, it is impossible to withhold it.
Some change, however, will Soon become absolutely necessary, for if I was to continue this harmlefs inaDive life, my coffers would fill, and my perSon grow enormous. Do but think of me in my day of probation, dipping into Baker’wS

If the thing was once to get air, I should be unable to shew my face in politer circles ; but I am weary of the beau-monde, and the gambling table never was my taste. Unfatigued by ceremony, undebauched with wine, unperplexed by cares, and unpalled with Superfluities, what desire can be ungratisied, except the desire of obtaining MiSs Le Fever’s approbation ? She is now returned to town, George, yet is my penance unremitted : I will be patient, and by following my example, you will at length arrive at the conclusion of this intolerable loner letter :
O
only one word more—who can the charming girl have to write ta, if male-correspondents—don’t be alarmed Flendon, I only mean that I should be tempted to enquire into the merit of their pretensions to Such an indulgence : but how shall I procure E 5	So

Fortune may be both a whimsical and perverSe jade, my friend, but I am per-Suaded she will bleSs me with fome happy opportunity when I least expect it, in which confidence I will to bed, and should flattering visions deign to visit my pillow, I will receive them as the precious rewards of the forbearance and Self-denial I have fo long pradliSed. She never came down the whole evening; I hope it will not, however, be the last of our lives; and if I do not bring her to another kind of behaviour, believe me no longer.

From the fame, to the fame.
A Gain at Mrs. LeeSons, why truly George I may breathe, but I live only when under her roof.
It was about five in the afternoon when I ventured to renew my visit. The old lady was not to be found in any of her apartments.
I am Sure, Sir, Said Jenny, the good-natured girl you have Seen there, my mistrefs was in the dining-room but this very instant; I fancy she must be stepped’ up to Mrs. Le Fever..
Jenny, returned I, you are a very goodt young woman, I have often heard Mrs. LeeSon mention you with approbation ; and for her fake, if, as in the courfe of years is most probable you should be the Survivor, you shall never want a friend. You have been kind, I understand like-E 6	wiSe,.
84 The History of
wiSe, to the worthy but unfortunate Ladies, your mistresses new acquaintance.
Oh, Sir, Said Jenny, (Some pearly drops trembling in her not diSagreeable eyes) who could reSuSe to be Serviceable to Such amiable perSons. Mrs. Le Fever had lodged Some time in this houSe before I ever Saw the young lady, but one morning, I shall never forget it, she came in the greatest diScompoSure, flew up to her mother’s apartment, and hanging about her neck, cried, it is over, my dear mother, forgive your child this first instance of undutifulnefs, and all my future actions shall be regulated by your will.
Methinks I hear them now, continued Jenny, it was fo moving. My dearest life, replied Mrs. Le Fevre, what have you done, forfeited your last your only friend, and in the moment of your greatest need. I should have fuffered but a short period, and then you would have been wholly Lady Catherine’s, but who
will
Miss L E F E V E R. 85 will now prote6I and provide Sor you when I am no more.
Forbear, my dear mother, cried the young lady, Sorbear thoSe killing expreffi-ons, heaven will be propitious to the prayers and endeavours of filial tender-neSs. My disposition is better Suited to the calamities of virtue, than all the un-fatisfaflory pleafures that greatneSs can bestow. Could any thing compenfate your loSs, lost perhaps by my negleft : let me at least have the conSolation of knowing that I was in no degree acceS-fary to the greatest evil that can befal me ; then blefs your poor child, bleSs and pardon her, and all may yet be well.
I hope, Sir, you will excuSe my prating So fast. Said the worthy Jenny, blushing and recolleDing herfelf, but indeed I could talk of them forever.
You have obliged me extremely, Jenny, Said I, and I should be glad to hear Some farther particulars ; but Mrs. Leefon might be Surprifed to find you and I in
Such
✓
Sfi The History or
Such clofe conversation, unleSs she was acquainted with the Subjedt. Another time, my good girl, you will not let me find you leSs communicative.
She curteSied, and looked a little con-fuSed : you will take the trouble, Jenny,, added I, in the kindest accent, to let Mrs. LeeSon know I am here.
Jenny tripped up stairs ; and as I was determined not to be diSappointed of See-, ing MiSs Le Fever on So Sair an opportunity, I followed her steps with the utmost confidence.
Your friends, madam. Said Mrs. Le Fever, So Soon as Jenny had announced my arrival, must always be acceptable with us ; but as you are the best judge of their rank and diSpofition, I cannot pre-Sume to invite them into my apartment Vvithout your SanDion : the gentleman does not appear to want condeScenfion.
We shall very probably wait upon you,returned Mrs. LeeSon, but I must just
Speak
Miss LE FEVER. 87
Speak one word to him before his intro-duDion.
That you cannot, my good madam, Said I, presenting mySelf, Jenny knows I did not wish to break up, but, if possible, augment an agreeable party. LeiSure is-the parent of impertinence, but you have So frequently tolerated me, that I cannot deSpair upon this occasion.
Is it not extraordinary, Mrs. Le Fever, Said the harmleSs Mrs. LeeSon, that So-young a gentleman, with many gay and valuable connexions, can devote So large a portion of his time to the company and conversation mf So elderly a relation as I am : but during your abSence he was my constant visitant (how charmingly it told George) and I dare Say you will have no objeXion to assist me in Supporting my conSequence with him.
Where the heart is So well known as I flatter my Self mine is, returned Mrs. Le Fever, proSeffions are needleSs ; I shall always, Sir, be glad of an opportunity of obliging you»	What
88 The History or
What we are deficient in, cried Mrs. LeeSon, poor unSuSpeOing creature, Mifs Kitty shall accomplish : we will have a Song after tea, and instead of the Superannuated partner Mr. Smith has hitherto diSpenSed with, I will recommend this blooming damSel, what Say you to the exchange my young friend ?
That Mrs. LeeSon has the art, returned I, to render every Succeeding visit the most delightSuI, and the last enjoyed is always liked the best.
A good pretty stroke, George, but failed of its desired effeD : the lovely in-fenfible was apparently unmoved, nor even bestowed one inquisitive glance upon the moitified Clerage.
But great enterprises require great virtues, patience, application, judgment, and perseverance. I have it all compleatly planned, but must be wary in the execution, step by step advances the approved veteran.
MiSs Le Fever was called upon in due
feaSon
Miss L E F E V E R. 89
SeaSon for the promiSed Song: I will not overpower you with raptures, George, you know my partiality, and may gueSs my Sentiments. You beheld, you admired the mouth that was formed for my destruDion, and may remember how peculiarly every feature was turned, to diSplay and communicate the most exalted admiration. I will only add, that Mrs. Lee-Son Says, she never heard a more pleasing voice in her life.
Cards were now introduced : is there a more eligible Seat on earth, than opposite a fair partner ? but Hendon she is fairest of the fair, nor did I fail to avail myfelf to the utmost of my happy situation : her eyes could not always avoid meeting mine; cold complaisance was no addition to their natural lustre, tho’ I could not have wished So much evil to the bitterest enemy I have in the world, as to have been compelled to Sustain the dangerous encounter.
She plays admirably at quadrille ; but
as
90 TheHistoryo?
^as she observes, it is not the greatest excellence in the female charafler to make a figure at the card-table ; and yet vrhere it is purSued merely as an innocent arauSe-ment, it can be no resteftion to diScard with judgment, win with moderation, and loSe with temper. In short, this one ,	evening has So intirely Subdued my whole
foul, that was she any other creature (as I have already told you) than MiSs Le Fever, you might tremble Sor her Safety, but there you shall ever find me a man cf the stridlest honour, and

Fro7n the fame to the fame.
I Tell you, George, that a title in many caSes is a very inconvenient possession. A ticket Sor the Magdalen, MiSs Le Fevre had long wished to visit that noble
retreat
Miss LE FEVER. 91
retreat for the wretched (no ill omen I hope, but Mrs. LeeSon, Mrs. Le Fever, and Mrs. Stubbs, thought it too great a fatiffue for them to engage in.
Dare you trust the young lady to my care, madam, Said I, to Mrs. Le Fever, or rather will she trust heisielf, for she is abundantly the least propitious to me upon every occasion.
To convince you, sir, Said MiSs Le Fever, with a most enchanting Smile, how ill-grounded that notion is, I will gladly attend you.
The morning Service was disapproved as not being the taste : this piece of folly I forget who Suggested it, cost me Some impatient hours, but the longest day has its termination.
She was dressed: well we will not enter upon So fertile a SubjeD.
Jenny was So exceedingly delighted, tlrat iVliSs Le Fever was going to be entertained, that I was in terrible panics
lest
92 The History of
lest she should betray the conlequence her amuSement was of to me.
Behold us now in the coach, for I had many reaSons for not handing her as might have been expefted : her glove was off, George, and we were Surrounded by Spedlators. I love to play a Sure card, nnleSs when Some very great advantage may be gained by a flippery one.
You have not lived long in town, I prefume, madam. Said I, in order to start a conversation, or it would not have been in my power to conduct you to any new Scenes.
Your conjecture is very just, sir, returned she, as to my general situation : I never was fond of London, nor would I now reside in it, if my inclination alone was to be confulted. I am furprifed, cried I, to hear fo young a lady make Such a declaration. London is the center of all that is gay and delightful ; sine eyes and Sprightly hearts Seldom doat upon inanimate proSpets.
I
Miss LE FEVER. 93
I own, sir, Said she, my taste is singular:
I have a kind of natural aversion to noiSc and confusion, which has been greatly increaSed by obServing the errors many people of understanding commit in the choice of happinefs. To compel onefelf to engage in unpleasing Scenes for any extraordinary advantage to eitherourSelves or Sellow-creatures is one thing, and to voluntarily embrace the clamor and disorder of life another. I have feen my acquaintance return from what they have called diversion, worn down with languor and fatigue, with many other astonishing and difgusting particulars.
Sure, madam, you have been accustomed to enjoy fairy Scenes, Said I, whll you favour me with a curSory deScription of them to enable me to form a right judgment of your eledlion and Sentiments.
In the Sober, rural w^alk, sir, within my late inSpeftion, nothing can strike you but .. what is natural or pleasing.
The labourer, having finished his work,

The day of general rest is considered by him as the greatest of all human bleffings ; and having exer-ciSed himSelf in a6Is of devotion and harmleSs recreations during that most refreshing period, he the next morning re^ fumes his weekly toil with redoubled alacrity. DiSeaSe and diScontent Seldom find the way to his habitation ; and his wife Supplies the want of delicacy and polish, in tenderneSs and uSefulnefs.
Such are the lower claSs of mortals at a distance from the metropolis ; and bliSs and eafe rife by due gradations from the cottage to the man of competence, and So on until it reaches the affluent dome.
Where the circumstances are happy, the mind and body enjoy unutterable delight: to contemplate the all-animating Spring ; to behold the ripened beauties of the Summer; to study the moral, the im struDive page of autumn; and to hear
the

the rough blasts oS the hoary feaSon, without inconvenience, vice, or diSmay. Is it not to be peculiarly favoured ; and when you add the means of diffusing blessings around you, of chearing the heart of age, and assisting the worthy wishes and elide Ivors of youth, do you not constitute a paradiSe on earth. Yet this is the never-failing prerogative of greatnefs; tho*
So little exerted, or even remembered, where the contagion of courts, and th« fantastic pleafures of vanity prevail.
I observed, sir, continued she, what HstleSneSs the great experience in the pur- , Suit of what they call pleaSure : but how shall I exprefs the miSery and wretched-neSs of the inferior inhabitants of this city. Guilt and disappointment are intolerable, tho'" not similar burthens; and ^ many a worthy heart is oppressed with tmguish, by the proSpeD of Sufferings it is unable to relieve : be Side v/hat I have mentioned, there is another very Severe evil; most ranks, of people outlive them-

Selves ; they cannot resist the temptations by which they are Surrounded ; and rather than paSs unnoticed, they expoSe themSelves to ridicule, cenSure, and diS-esteem. The only art of living is to confine our wishes within the limits of our circumstances, be they what they may, or judicioussy to resign the rein to every laudable inclination: common SenSe and common caSe, as the poet tells us, are most unquestionably equal ; and if we once adopt the one for our grand regulator, the other will be the infallible re-fult.
What think you now, Hendon, of Le Fever’s daughter, or do you not conceive that your friend is in the greatest danger ? I cannot marry at this early period, and I will not betray her, unleSs I should most unexpedledly difcover Some ugly feature in her chara6ler that tends towards hypo-criSy. If she is what she appears, how Sweetly amiable; but should she be a hypocrite, even the Magdalen-houfe would
be
Miss LE FEVER. 97
be defiled by harbouring So unparallelled a monster : but perhaps you may have no objedlion to visiting the penitents.
We reached the chapel in due time: I conSeSs that refledlion, rather than conversation, had Sor Some part of the way been my choice. We got a good Seat; the singing was very pretty, but my fair Saint complained of the indevotion of the whole congregation.
There feems to be but two forts of people here, faid she, the entertainers and the entertained : I own I do not find the fo-lemnity, the gratitude, the contrition, or pious fatisfaflion I hoped to have been witneSs to.
You have been there, George, and can judge of the propriety or impropriety of her observation: but she Seeks for that purity of manners, that fensibility of foul, that is not to be found beyond her own breast. How came she to remain fo uncontaminated ; Lady Catherine Oldham fees much polite company; why did not a ray of ambition, a Spark of vanity, com-F	rnunicate

Our aukwaist carriage obeyed my nod, and I now ventured to assist her tender steps. She withdrew her handj however, Ibmewhat pertly, conScious, I SuppoSe, of a gentle presstire. The ice is broke, thought I, theSe little fearful simpletons provoke the very treatment of which they are most apprehensive.
My dear MiSs Le Fever, Said I, rather familiarly, it can be no new thing to you to be admired ; but perhaps you never met with one So capable of sincere refpeD as myfelf, but you must allow me a hap-pinefs I have long wished for, but never tssl this mexment had a convenient opportunity of Soliciting.

Do not attempt to abufe me, sir, whatever were your original motives for concealing your true charaDer, they can now Subsist no longer.

At once, my Lord, to oblige you, and convince you of the propriety of my refo-lutions, a gentleman that Sat behind me at the chapel, betrayed your name, and I fuppoSe you cannot have forgot the poor Innkeeper s daughter.

I muff, with shame acknowledge, that I was of the hunting party : dined among the rest at the inn, and heard many encomiums vUpon the fair Parfhtmpe ; but I had not the minutest concern in her SeduDion, nor even knew the preciSe time when it happened. As well might the world accuSe you of this angel’s fall, (if she was to fall
by

by any wicked praDices of mine, which heaven avert] becauSe you was privy to my pursuit oS her, and half acknowledged intentions, as charge that creature’s ruin upon me. I am nevertheless taken with the cranes, and in all probability, in this vestal’s rigid judgment, shall likewiSe Suffer with them.
I would have Said a vast deal to exculpate mySelf, but she cut me short with,
I do not SuppoSe your Lordship is So poor a sinner, as not to have much to Say in your own deSence. I wish it may avail you at the most awful oS tribunals ; as to me, you may Spare yourSelf the trouble oS laboring the point, as your utmost eloquence would be fruitleSs.
Provoked beyond all patience, I was So unguarded as to curSe my companions of that day’s excursion.
I hear you, sir. Said she, (her countenance corresponding with her expreffions) with her ; and if I did not consider you as a Seducer, you kindly convince me you are a very prophane gentleman, which F3	I
i02 T H E H I S TO RY OF
I must be So bold as to Say, is but an ugly Ipeciinen of a valuable heart.
The coach was now whirling on at a violent rate, and I greatly apprehended would reach Mrs. LeeSon’s, beSore my conversion of the little infidel. I therefore put my head out of the window ; you raScal, exclaimed I, v/ith a vehemence I have had leifure to repent of, did I not order you to drive stow. This is perhaps, continued I, as I reSumed my feat, the only opportunity I may ever have of expostulating with you, as you are So strongly prejudiced in-my disfavor, and it shall not be curtailed I insist upon.
O, your Lordship is all goodneSs, Said she, with a Sneer, that she must have borrowed ; and if I am hereafter at a lofs in what mamrer to conduD myfelf, I should ill deferve the obligations you now confer upon me.
Mifs Le Fever, cried I, Seizing both her hands, do not push matters to the last extremity : I adore your perSon, and honour your Sentiments, but 1 cannot Support
the
Ml ss L E F E V E R. 103
the cruel contempt wish which you treat me. I may have been a gay man, but I never yet was the Seducer of innocence, nor shall you harbour that opinion of me.
You are very arbitrary, sir, returned she, but till you can make it appear that you have a right to controul my private opinion, I cannot be all obedience.
Your father, the honest, brave, valuable Captain Le Fever, cried I, would neither have dared, nor been inclined to treat me in this manner: he would at least have listened to my justification.
She lifted up her sine eyes to heaven; the monster before her was not worthy of one glance. At length, my Lord, Said she, with an averted, face, if you knew the father, can you refrain from pitying the un-happy child. He has now no arm to defend me, no means of sheltering my miserable head from the roughest blasts; nor «an he die in revenging the injuries hi$ daughter may fustain; he had but ont life, my Lord, and that was given to. hi country.

I beSeech you, MiSs Le Fever, Said I, relinquishing my hold, (she has too much pathos, George) only hear me a few words, I mean not better to my own Soul than I do to you. We must not part on unfriendly terms. Mrs. LeeSon, Mrs. Le Fever, must not be informed either of your diScovery, or our disagreement. I will never offend you a Second time, only grant me this request, and let my future treatment be Suited to my future deferv-ins:$.
Do not put it out of my power to oblige you, my Lord, by requesting what I ought not to grant. I abhor Secrets; and should I have any from Such a friend and mother as you have mentioned, was I capable of Such baSe injustice and ingratitude, what kind of impreffion would you not necessarily receive of me. To convince you, however, that it is not merely to gratify a talking inclination, but from aflual principle, that I am an enemy to referve, I will not proclaim the conversation that has passed between us, if that
will

will be any SatisfaDion to you ; and that, my Lord, is an indulgence you had little reaSon to expe6l from me.
I v/as So chagrined, that I pleaded an engagement, and having Seen her Safe into Mount-street, took an abrupt leave. I could not think of encountering my worthy friends at So mortifying a period, and she must tell her story for once as she pleaSes.
But she shass hear of me again in a very short time, notwithstanding all her artifice j and I begin to apprehend that I shall find it necessary, in order to make her Sensible of the vanity of human wif-dom, to lead even her obstinate virtue astray.

my (however offensive) endeavors to awaken you to a timely fenSe of the baSe-neSs that is maturing in your late generous heart.
Is it then poffible that you can So amazingly degenerate, as to take advantage of unmerited poverty, and add Sresh stings to the cruellest oS afflidions.
It can be only a falSe notion oS honor, that prevents my apprising the worthy creature of her danger : yet I will forbear ; you cannot intend to make a dishonourable attempt, where it is So evident (as even to strike you with convidion) that you would meet with a repulSe. My Lord v/ill be no objed of either admiration or terror with her.
How can good Mrs. LeeSon be So infatuated as to become the adual pander to your wishes, Sensible as She is of the barbarity of vice, and the greatnefs of the temptation.
Can I, may I trust you ? or rather ought you to trust yourfelf ? I do declare, that So diabolical an adion would wholly
estrange

estrange my affedlions, and you would find yourSelS a prey to the bitterest re-morSe.
What folly, what madneSs, persist lii purfuing what you cannot wish to obtain : but the chief Spur it Seems is the novelty of the chace ; you expert, you hope for difficulties; and to divert yourSelf, cast be So cruel as to torture the innocent and unoffending.
But give me leave to alk you, where you intend to stop, and you prOfeSs that marriage is intirely out of the question. What confliDs are you then preparing Sot yourSelf: if after having fed a growing af-^ fedlion, until it is not only become trou-*. blefome, but unconquerable, you are to tear yourSelf from all your foul holds dear, to prevent the world's arraigning your discretion.

I expefled no lefs from your generous, your pathetic apostrophe, to the poor departed hero, than that you meant to transplant his blighted family into a happier Soil. They are already allied to nobility, nor can I perceive any thing preposterous in whatever designs you may form with jeSpecl to the worthy Le Fevers daughter^ except Such as are barbarous and unjustifiable.
As MiSs Le Fever is the preSent objedt of your purfuit, I have confined myfelf to the enforcing her strong and irresistible claim to your honourable consideration: but I must, at the fame time, take leave to obferve, that a finished form, well-cultivated "manners, and delicate principles, will, wherever found, be an infassible Sandliou fpr generous approbation.

NOW, Arthur, I am wholly yours : I will conquer my weakneSs for a lump of romantic mortality, that would Sacrifice my everlasting peace to the most abSurd and far - fetched Sentiments of honor.
Only read this Second leflure from Sir George, and you will Soon be convinced that I have bounded to the utmost verge : he will Surely blow up all my happy views and expectations, if I do not defcend to write him an epistle upon his own Sober plan, by the very return of the post.
But pray obferve what a compound of contradictions and nonfenfe he has Sent: first he will awaken me, and then he is convinced I am not asseep : this moment I am clawed off most mercilefsly, and the next entreated to Ipare the gentle viCtim. Then his provoking taunts of the improbability
112 The History of
bability of my Succeeding with her, are they to be Supported ? but his intimation of betraying the Secrets of our correspondence, shocked me to that degree, that I know not when I shall recover mySelf. Your honest fellows are very uSeful on Some occasions, but dreadSully dangerous on others.
Even poor Mrs. LeeSon does not eScape his virulence, but I can tell him his Ian.-guage is much too rough for So elderly and reSpeDable a gentlewoman. How prettily he demands may he trust me ? ought he to go from home for SatisfaDion in that particular ? and-as for his ought I to trust myfelf, I acknowledge is doubtfuh I have my infirmities, Arthur, and am not a Sir George Hendon: but it were end-lefs to attempt a diffecsiion of his abfurdi-ties ; I will only beg you to attend to his admirable Set of refleDions, beginning in madneSs, and ending in torture, together with his disingenuous purpofe of inciting me to Sacrifice my darling liberty, in order to purchaSe my freedom,
But
Miss L E F E V E R. 113^
But matrimony is too antiquated and battered a Sorm to captivate your friend, except in the last exigence ; for she must be obtained, let the price be ever So extravagant.
I am So unSucceSsfuI, JohnSon, that I cannot help believing there is Some Secret witchcraft, Some covered fraud, that counterworks all my endeavours : it shall be unravessed, let the confequence be what it may.
Death and destruflion is it come to this ? to doat upon a miferable, proud, mean female j doat upon her in Ipite of inclination, reashn, and conviftion: it is indeed both torture and raadnefs ; but she must, she shall be mine ; and the puppy that has fnivelled himfelf into her favor, shall either resign her to my prior claim, or I will deal very roughly by him.
But I always begin at the wrong end of a tale; the caufe, not the effefi, should be first communicated : yet who can help raving ! no Anthony, no Alexander, was
half
114 The History of
half So weak or deSperate. Had I ten thouSand worlds, I would Sacrifice them aU, rather than be deprived of the most finissted mortal that ever existed.
O, JohnSon, I now begin to feel what I always conceived to be mere cant: fortune, titles, dignities, what do they avail their poffeffors. A curate, the lowest and most deSpicable of curates, but I will explain myfelf more to your Satisfaflion.
IhavenotSeen this, no name is either too good or too bad for her as she has managed it; enchantresses let me call her ; thefe two whole days miSerable enough, you may be certain I have been, by what you know of my impatient and troubleSome disposition ; and it came into my head a few hours ago, to stroll out and take a view of the houSe forSooth, that contains the precious girl. I may perhaps See Jenny, thought I, and acquire Some intelligence : what! Sculk like an eves-dropper, demanded my pride, tO' be Spurned and de-SpiSed. HaughtineSs was natural to Some people, and cringing to others ; but whatever
xM I s s L E F E V E R. 11 r.
vy-
ever degree oS the former I might have in my composition, I was Satisfied I did not poffeSs a single atom of the latter, nor would I So egregioussy feed the vanity of any woman, let me fuffer what I would.
A gentler passion then assuming the reins, I recolleded that it was only Some coriveisiation with Jenny;, the honest humble Jenny, that I meant to Seek aSter, and I might depend upon her best information : but if she should betray me ? betray, what ? that I met her by accident, and listened to her prattle:—no, no, trust her for that; it was her own fecret, not mine, and I might fafely rely upon her.
I went, Arthur, and would you believe it, in the very instant that I reached Mrs. Leefon’s door, did Jenny come out with fome letters in her hand.
Mrs. Jenny, Mrs. Jenny, cried I, in a low voice, but away she whished.—The women are all bewitched, exclaimed I, in a rage, only look at them, and they conceive you are going to devour them. I did not, however, let her efcape me, but
having
1 i6 The History of
having overtaken her in a convenient place for my purpoSe, Mrs. Jenny, Said I, have you forgot your old friend Mr. Smith ?
Blest me, sir, my Lord I mean, returned the fluttered fool, (So Le Fever kept her word with me) I did not fee your Lord-ship, I did not know your Lordship, I was So frightened.
Where are you going, my girl, demanded I in the most friendly accent ? who do thefe letters (and I could Scarce restrain my itching fingers) belong to.
Indeed, your Lordship, Said Jenny, ought not to tamper with a poor Servant, you are not to See them.
Not See them ! cried I, in a kind of frenzy, (Snatching them in the Same moment out of her hands) no noiSe I beSeech you, Mrs. Jenny, I mean no harm to you, your mistrefs, nor your mistrefsst friend ; but who told you I was not to fee shem ?
No-body, sir, Said the poor quivering girl.
How durst you then trifle with me, returned I, a little sternly: do you not know
that
M iss L E FEVER. 117
, that paffion and madneSs are the fame thing; it is well I was not provoked to uSe you ill.
O, my Lord : Lord me no Lords, Said I, callme Smith, any thing but that mouth-Sul of formality. Have I not alvvays behaved kindly to you ? the last time we met, no perSon could be civiler or more chatty than yourfelS; but now you have Set that Lordjlfip between us, I Suppofe I have nothing to expeD but Silence and reServe.
Indeed, sir, Mr. Smith, returned the poor terrified creatuye, I will Say what you pleaSe, I will do any thing to oblige you, only let me carry the letters Safe : I promised MiSs Le Fever not even to lay them down out of my hands, for fear they should be forgot.
No more of the letters, my good Jenny, Said I, I give you my honor I will deliver them myfelf at the post-houSe. You must tell me what all the family Said to Mifs Le Fevers coming home alone on
Sunday,
ii8 The History or
Sunday, and what constructions are put upon my abSenting mySelS.
Oh, dear sir, pray sir, cried Jenny, don*t be angry with a poor girl for wishing to do her duty, only let me go to the post*-■office with you.
What a Sool, Said I, do you doubt my veracity ? can you SuSpeD I would de*-ceive you ? you know wdio I am, and my charaOer ls at stake.
Do but mind her anSwer, JohnSon.
Ah, sir, a Servant’s charaCler is indeed of the utmost conSequence, for if they w'ant a charaDer they must want bread : but people of fashion, I believe, Seldom talk of any Such thing.
I love you for your simplicity, Jenny, Said I, but learn to know me better. Some persons may be So baSe as to diSregard their words, but my word is every thing with me, as you shall be convinced. If you do not hear, my girl, that theSe letters arrive SaSe, agreeable to their Several di-restions, then never more trust man, let
his
Miss LE FE V ER. 119
his protestations be "ivshat they may. Will you accept oS a pair of gloves ?
Indeed, indeed, sir, 1 will not accept of any thing but your good-wili; it shall never be Said that I was bribed. MiSs Le Fever is all goodneSs to me; and to be paid on every hand, would be the vilest thinsf in nature. I have not lived
O
fo long with Mrs. LeeSon, but I know what goodneSs means, and would practice it too if I could. I shall cry all night about theSe letters.
Flold your tongue, huffy, Said I Smiling, and I will intrust you with a most im -portant Secret:—I am in love with MiSs Le Fever.
Heaven forbid, sir, exclaimed the good girl : if you could ruin Such a young lady, you can do any thing.
I abjure the thought: I love her better than I do myfelf, and would not injure her for ten thoufand worlds.
And will you marry her, sir, demanded the pretty gipfey. O, dear sir, she will make the Sweetest of ladies; fo humble,
i2o" The History or
ble, So charitable, So good ; and will you Speak for me to live with her, iS I should have the misSortune to bury my preSent worthy mistreSs. I can work well with my needle, and wash Small linen, and—
Yes, yes, Jenny, Said I, impatient to change the Subjedl, if I can but once per-Suade her to have me, I can anSwer Sor the rest.
’	I am So glad, repeated she, with an
honest earnestneSs, then I can have done no harm in parting with the letters : but indeed, sir, you terrified me ; Sure you will never be in Such a passion with poor MiSs Le Fever, she is all gentleneSs, mild-neSs, and —
Never fear, Jenny, and now won’t you tell me all you know ?
La, fir. Said she, you have put every thing clear out of my head, I can think of nothing but MiSs Le Fever s being a lady: I hope it will not run as glibly off my tongue, as it does over my mind.
Take care, Jenny, that wmuld be to ruin the perSon you most love.
:	But
f
Miss L E F E V E R. 121
But why, but why, sir, reSumed the delighted creature, don’t you tell them all what you propoSe ? O dear, it would be Such joy to their hearts.
May be not, Jenny, I fuSpedt MiSs Le Fever has Another lover, and I could not bear to be reSuSed. O falSehood, that •ever thou shouldst be So prophetic !
Sure you cannot SuSpedl Mr. Leceister, returned Jenny, in a Second tremor, he only brought a letter out of the country ; he is most certainly a very pretty young gentleman, and Seems to admire (but who does not admire) MiSs Le Fever. I ne-ner Saw any thing particular between them, except when he Saluted her the morning she went to Kensington.
Saluted her! wretch, exclaimed derate, how dared he even to think of So bold an action ; tvhat’s his name ? where does he live ?
Better be any thing, faid Jenny, and have the proSpedt of a little peace, than So violent a gentleman, and be my lady.
And will you tell MiSs Le Fever as G	much,
122 The History of
much, Mrs. Jenny, demanded I, vehemently ?
O, Sir,—
Swear you will never mention me, continued I, taking hold of her hands, but with the hia;hest commendation, or you shall never See her more.
Forgive me, sir, excuSe me —
Swear then, cried I; I am Satisfied, by your reludtance to take an oath, you would religiousty obServe it: Swear then this instant, and we will be as good friends as ever.
The trembling timid Soul did at length venture to repeat a Solemn promiSe after me ; but I could perceive her foolish heart was ready to burst with terror and obstinacy .
Come, come, my good girl, Said I, dry up your tears and compoSe yourSelf. To be Sure the corner of this court is pretty retired, or what would people have thought of us ? could you _have been more agitated, if your very life had been in danger.
Life,
■ Ml ss L E F E V E R. 123
LiSe, sir, repeated she, rather Saucily, I don’t know what you mean, sir, if folks honesty is not dearer to them than every other consideration, I think they are not very sit to live : but tho’ you have forced me to Swear never to Speak my worst thoughts of you to this poor young lady, I will never join to do her the Smallest injury ; you shall kill me first; and now I have told you all my mind I shall be much easier.
Well then, my dear Jenny, Said I, as we have wasted much time to little purpoSe, and the family may wonder what has detained you, only promife to meet me on the fame Spot at half an hour after eight to-morrow evening, and I will immediately go and execute the commiffion with which you have intrusted me.
Remember, sir, replied Jenny, with a tragical oh in her countenance, that my whole happineSs is at stake ; and as you wish peace to your own breast, do not make a bad uSe of the power you have gained over a Simple, honest girl: should G 2	the
i'24 The History or
the letters miScany, I will run away let what will be the conSequence ; for I could never bear to be SuSpeSled of a prailice I most abhor, bribery and corruption. Good night: I am but a poor fervant its true ; but if I might go with you to the post—
Be fatissied, Jenny, faid I, you shall have no reafon to repent your involuntary tranSgreffion of MiSs Le Fever’s request. I will as Safely depoSite them as you youisielf would have done (only gratifying my curiosity with reSpefl to their contents) ;• you know there is Such a thing as talking aside upon occasion.
My impatience to examine the prize I had obtained was So great, that I turned into the first coffee-houSe I came to; and having Seated mySelf in a private box, drew the precious epistles with great caution, tlio’ much trepidation, out of my pocket.
The first I glanced my eye upon was of no concern to me, as I was well acquainted with both the charaDers, and
the
M I s s L E FEVER. ^25’
tlie country correspondent to whom it was addressed. The only friend, I believe, Mrs. LeeSon claims besides mySelS.
The Second was from the little traitoreSs to one MiSs Winter, her boSom Sriend and confidant I SuppoSe : but how shall I inform you of what almost blasted my sight ' in the instant of my beholding it. The third was dirested to that very paltry curate I mentioned in the beginning of this letter. I tore open the Seal too abruptly, considering I must make it good, and had. the plec^ure to read as follows:
To Mr, L E c E 1 s T E R.
Sir,
“ According to my promiSe arid best calculation, this letter will greet you immediately on your arrival at Birmingham; for, if I mistake not, youTaid your buSi-nefs would detain you a whole week upon the road; and if my good wishes have been efficacious, neither fatigue nor diffa-tisfacstionhave been your portion.
G 3	“I
126 The History of
“ I own I have particular pleaSure in the proSpeD of our correspondence: I know you lenSible, and I believe you sin-' cere : there is but one impediment that I can foreSee to my utmost wishes and expectations being anSwered.
“ Vdiy will you not peisiuade yourSelS that my friendship is fixed as fate ; that I have been rather Suddenly attached I must acknowdedge, but approbation works quick upon the Soul, and can best be accounted Sor by ypur own feelings. As it is not my constitution to be over-warm in any inclination, there is the stronger probabiT lity oS my permanence. What you call love, you must give me leave to know by the title of esteem : the one depends upon the fancy, the other on the judgment; and you cannot be offended to have rea-Son concerned on So important an occasion.
“ I cannot help congratulating mySelf as well as you, that our acquaintance has ' commenced at the very period it has done. Our charaDers barely Sormed, our faculties still unSolding themSelves, our minds
unhack^
Miss L E FEVER 127
unhackneyed in the arts oS liSe, and our dispositions, I hope not, uncbrrigible: what advantages may we not derive from it. I know the kind oS perSon I could like to Spend my days with ; and by observing the Several changes you are likely to be exerciSed in, of hope, fear, doubt, and perplexity, I shall not only be enabled to discover, but to SoSten or invigorate the most predominant, the most irrestraiii-able, and most worthy paffions you are endued with.
“ You Seem at preSent diSpoSed to deliver yourSelf up to the delusions of fond credulity : I am the most extraordinary of mortals, and we must be happy.
*' I shall not attempt to undeceive you, weinSensibly recover our reaSon when we least expeflt it: the brightest objefls become at length familiar to our sight; and as the glare wears off, or rather as our eyes acquire strength, we are capable of examining thofe perfestions minutely, we once took only in the groSs. Enjoy your enthusiaSm then, my friend, fo long
as
128 T H E H I s T O R Y O' R
as it lasts; but the moment you perceive-it begin to wain, avail yourSelS of the lucid interval. Weigh well the merits and: demerits of your newdy-created idol; and should the former abfually over-balance the latter, you ought to sit down contented—for remember frailties as well as charms, are the portion of humanity.
“ Let us proceed upon a rational plan : your prosperity will be ever grateful tp me, your happineSs essential to my own ; and tho’ you was to ceafe to be my lover, you should continue to be my friend,. The language of sincerity must be pleasing, and the affedtion of fenfibility at ass times acceptable : flattery is a meannefs in the undesigning, and the grand engine of the bafe and ungenerous; it cannot therefore have any place where truth and faith become the question. In one word, my friend, by ceasing to consider me as la goddefs, you would render me a very happy woman.
I shall be glad to hear from you again whenever it is-convenient, and hope we
shall

Pistols, poniards, with every instrument oS death, now'danced before my distracted imagination ; but recolIeSbng I might be observed, I constrained mylelS in the best manner I was able, and calling for pen and ink, discharged all that vengeance ' upon paper, I could ill contain within*, my own breast : then tearing it in pieces, as an evidence of my folly and extravagance, I once more endeavoured to read, the dire confeffion of the most valuable of hearts.

Read her own language, and if it is the piDure of her foul, you must allow it is a most beautiful one. What do I fay ? but I shall be intjrely reformed in fpite of my-Self; for do I not love, do I not admire

virtue for its intrinfic value only ? nor can I wonder at all the bustle that is made about it, when it can wmrk fo palpably upon a heart that Suffers, nay that bleeds from its existence.
I shall never come to the letter, unlefs I throw it upon you abruptly. To attempt to introduce it with any kind of propriety, is the weaknefs of frenzy, for does it not contain my irrecoverable condemnation.

“ You mush my dear Polly, you shall be reconciled to my eleSlion, for am I not the best judge of my own happineSs.
“ ThoSe that have never experienced the * folly of greatneSs, cannot form a proper idea of what they deSpiSe : but I have participated all the joys that vanity can bestow, the feasts of luxury, and the emp-tineSs of profusion, yet never did I derive any true felicity from them all. I tell you my disposition is calculated for humble Scenes : the ssenderly covered table, the neat but plain appearance has infinite charms for me. I know not- whether it is from humility or apprehension, but the condition that is least liable to change or interruption, is the only condition that I can approve. Are there any possessions equal to peace and tranquility ? and are they not peculiar to the meek and lowly of heart ?
“ With Mr. Leicester my proSpeDs are quite agreeable to my wishes; but you

are well acquainted with my Sentiments reSpefting him, and I need not repeat them : his merit justifies my partiality ; and you shall not withhold your approbation from neither the one nor the other.
“ I must inform you of an adventure I have lately met with.
“ You have frequently heard me expreSs how deeply both my friendship and gratitude are engaged to Mrs. LeeSon ; never was there a kinder neighbour, or more valuable woman ; but she has a relation, my dear ; you have heard of Lord Cle-rage,—he is the man, and a very trouble-Some and impertinent one I Sear I shall find him.
“ He would not be diSagreeable in his perSon, iS he was free from SelS-Sufficiency; nor unpleasing in his manners, if he would allow them to be natural ; but he has it Seems been ruined by the indulgence of his relations, the flattery of his dependants, and the early poffeshon of a noble fortune.
“ He is mighty fond of assuming a private
M iss L E F E V E R. 135
vate charadter ; and Mrs. LeeSon, who lives but to oblige every peision with whom she is conneDed, was easily prevailed upon to tolerate him in what she believed to be an innocent and rational inclination ; but she is as much unacquainted with his gaieties, as unSuSpicious oS his artifice.
“ I have not the vanity to think that his whole motive Sor visiting So gcoi a woman was merely on my account; but wherever he first beheld me, the novelty of my countenance struck his giddy fancy ; and finding me placed beneath his honourable consideration, incited him to purfue me for the bafest purpofes. I am, however, furprifed at his want of judgment ; the girl that could voluntarily renounce all that fortune, could procure, in order to render herfelf Serviceable to the best of mothers, must be fuperipr to the common methods of feduDion.
“ What arts can he play off, that I am not prepared to detefl and deSpife ; and what can he offer, what propofe, that virtue and humility would not contemn. Nay, I
think

think that, notwithstanding I must allow he has much merit, that had I never Seen Mr. Leceister, I could not, on the ho-t nestest terms, have approved him. He is So conScious of his own advantages, or perhaps it is my prejudice that gives him.; that appearance in my eyes, for I must GonfeSs that his every word is Specious,, his every aOion condeScension.
I am now at that very age that invites the crudest attempts; and my situation,, hut it is the only inconvenience of it, con— Spires to encourage the bold designer;. but what are the allurements of vke, that they can be fuppofed capable of undermining native purity, or what the gratifications of debauchery, that delicacy would not abhor ? is it the midnight revel, the lewd jest, the daring impertinence, or the ' barbarous infult, that proves the irresista-ble charm to evil ?

“ Perhaps you alk if Lord Clerage has preSumed to make dishonourable proposals to me ? can you doubt either the pre-fumption or villainy of a man, that could be engaged in Such an affair as the de-struDion of the inn-keeper’s daughter ?
“But I must acknowledge the a Dual indignity has not yet been offered; yet ' am I Satisfied, that want of opportunity, not inclination, has been the impediment.
“ Has he not made the most alarming

“ Mrs.
' Miss LE FEVER. 139
“ Mrs. LeeSon, the only deception I believe she ever prafliSed, gave him to us, on his first introdu6lion, for a country gentleman.
“ His eaSy addreSs, and insinuating po-liteneSs, beSpoke him of Superior rank. I was Sensible he v/as agreeable, but I was likewise Sensible he was confident: his visit happened too to be rather mal-a-propos : my heart was a good deal depressed by poor Leceister’s departure; and as I found his eyes rather bold and inquisitive, I reSolved to encounter them as Seldom as ' poshble. How would it mortify his pride, if he knew that I beheld him as an excellent foil for my unastliming lover ?
“ Very little passed that day : my pen employed me in my own apartment, whilst he condescended to Jhwffle and cut with his graver Sriends.
“ Mrs. LeeSon, whoSe commendation is an unquestionable Sandlion, mentioned him in Such favorable terms, that I at length began to relax the Severity of my behaviour; and as I found my reServe

“ Our conversation was light and unmeaning : compliments on his part, and trite observations on mine, silling up the whole Space between our houSe and the Magdalen-Chapel. We had not beer?., long Seated, before a gentleman and lady at Some little distance, whiSpered each other; “ it is him, it is Lord Clerage, I thought I could not be mistaken; that genteel air is perfeCly his own/'
“ The whole story of the inn-keeper's daughter instantly Suggested itSelf to my imagination. For what purpoSes, thought I, may I not have been conveyed to this' place. That poor injured girl was no more SuSpicious of her approaching fate, when she was deluded from her home, than I of this man’s real name or character, when I quitted mine ; but I will conceal the discovery I have So unexpeCedly '	made,
Mxss L E F E V E R. 141
made, unleSs I find the revealing it neceS-Sary to my own preservation.
“ We returned to our coach; my Lord took my hand with an appearance of the greatest reSpedl; but judge of my SurpriSe and apprehension, when I found him preSs it with very impertinent ardor. I hastily withdrew it: he looked politely confident, but Suddenly became So bold as to kiSs my cheek, with a Soolish empty Speech that I really do not rernember.
“ My fathers Spirit was rouSed in my heart, and I warmly reSented his audacious behaviour, when to my utter confusion he called to the coachman to abate his pace, and deScended to mutter cuisies and execrations.
“ He is, my dear, possessed of a fine turbulent diSpofition. Can I ever be Sufficiently thankSul that the gentle Leceister, not his boisterous Lordship, is likely to be master of my fate.
“ How guilt confounds even its strongest votaries : I stung him to the quick, by mentioning the Oxfordshire tranSaDtion.
He
142 The History or
He would have vindicated himSelf; but ' where is the villain that is willing to paSs Sor one. I, weak and inconsiderable as I am, awed him into silence, and Setting me down, his pride or his paffion, incited him to withdraw himSelf from my sight. I blessed the effesit, whatever was the cauSe.
My mother and Mrs. LeeSon were very pioussy employed ; they enquired Sor my gallant.
“ Why really, madam. Said I, addreffing Mrs. LeeSon, he has given me the flip : I discovered from the conversation of Some perSons that Sat near us, that the gentleman has a claim to honors and dignities ; and I think he w^as diSgusted, mortified, and offended, at my treating him with due distinclion.
“ I am Sorry, my dear MiSs Le Fever, Said Mrs. LeeSon, for the incident; it is his Lordship’s chieSest delight to converSe Y/ith his friends upon equal terms. Now will he return to all thoSe wild Sallies of youth, from which he appeared to be So

" O, madam, returned I, (by no means in love with her propoSal) let his Lord-ship follow his own inclinations, he will revisit you in a few days I will be an-Swerabie, and he cannot hurt himSelS much in that time. I wish for yourSake it had been otherwiSe, but I really SuSpeX he has more gaiety in his composition than you are aware of,
“ I love his company, Said the good lady, but you perliaps behold him with Ids partiality than I do, nor could I be willing to loSe it for a long period.
“ Two days have now passed away, and no Lord Clerage, I therefore begin to hope vre shall never more be troubled with him. I could forgive him every thing but his hypocriSy to this worthy woman.

You shall pay your perfonal honors to them, returned the worthy woman ; we will Spend this afternoon with them, if it is agreeable to your Lordship, to convince them that no incident can change our opinion of them.

We went up stairs: Mrs. Le Fever received us with her uSual complaiSance, which had fo large a portion of gratitude in it, as to be fufficient for any rank; and fo little fawning or fervility, as to be acceptable to every heart.
The young lady’s behaviour was agreeable to the good-fenfe she is mistreSs of; abundantly too reServed to be encouraging, and infinitely too pleasing to be forbidding ; she would astually make a very , pretty Countefs.
Nor do I fee where the impossibility lies, Arthur. Lady Catherine certainly brought
her

her up with an intention to bestow a good fortune upon her, and it strikes me that my honorable addresses would reconcile all parties.
But the priest—well, what of him ? he is beneath my consideration, therefore can never excite my apprehensions ; for depend upon it we should know how to deal with him, when once I have reSolved to make an abSolute facrisice of my beloved liberty.
Tho’ to confeSs the truth, I am greatly afraid it will be necessary to remove him for a time at least ; whilst he is upon the fpot, madam will be inaccessible. I would not injure him in any essential degree ; I feel mySelf but a puling half-ssedged villain ; but as I cannot exist without MiSs Le Fever, felf-prefervation will incite me to make Some deSperate push.

But to return to my visit--
I cast many tender, and as I intended penitential glances, upon the lovely girl, but she had the addreSs to appear wholly inSenSible to every thing but politeneSs, and wished me a good night with the fame eaSe and reSpedl as if I had been her grandfather.
What different materials different Se-males are compoSed oS: Some girls—but it is a Solly to talk, Arthur, they are not MiSs Le Fever’s, and their forWardneSs is quite as diSgusting, as her shyneSs is irresistibly captivating.
I am glad I have hit upon So happy an expedient for carrying my point; Lady Catherine will warmly promote my cauSe, and the dear Creature must yield.
Her Sedudlion was an infersial plot: Sor if an inn-keeper’s reSentment could riSe So high, JohnSon, on the ill-treatment of his child, might not the brave Le Fever be expeDed to break from his grave, to re-" verige his daughter’s violation ? but no, Le Fever, thy daughter’s heart, not her virtue, is my preSent game.

F Or ever in luck, Arthur, Sure the happiest of planets presided at my nativity.
Faffing negligently through Mount-street, (I have already expatiated on the power of attradlion) I Saw a hackney coach drawn up at Mrs. Leefon’s door, as for Some important purpoSe,	My

My heart—-well no matter Sor its palpitations—I reSolved to keep a sharp look ‘out, and inform my Self oS the cauSe, I thereSore immediately flipped into a little glove-shop that commanded a view of the premises, and lay as Snug as possible.
It,was not long beSore Mrs. Jenny appeared, leading her old mistreSs, who was no Sooner Seated, than Mrs. Le Fever and Mrs. Stubbs followed her into the carriage, and the fellow afcended the box.
The good old lady kindly drew up the blind between her and me, to defend her-Self, I SuppoSe, from a little misty rain. I took advantage of her caution, and catdi-ing Jenny's eyes, made her understand she was not to retire until I had Spoke with her. The wretch of a coachman was Some time siggetting about, before he thought proper to draw off the enemy, a circumstance that exerciSed my patience not a little.
Every obstacle at length removed, I advanced, Jenny, child, cried I, no I	words,

She is indiSpoSed, sir, Lid the little huffy, in great confusion, she is buSy ; the ladies are only gone to the Fleet, to t^ro-cure the enlargement of a poor tradelraan out of this neighbourliood.
I will, Jenny, returned I, Secure you from all blame : their charitable busineSs will detain them at least Some hours. I stole up you may fay, whilst you exchanged a word or two with an acquaintance that pasted by, or what elSe you pleaSe.
When I reached the landing-place of the Second stair-caSe, would you credit it, Artliur, I was astonished at my own impudence : I pauSed, I hesitated, but it would have been unmanly to retreat; and tapping gentle at the door, I received Such Soft encouragement, that I ventured to preSent inySelf.
MiSs Le Fever blushed : pride and haughty reSentment mantled on her cheek, and Sparkled in her eyes. To tell you I ' am Surprised, my Lord, Said she, in a loSty unfriendly accent—	Give

Give me leave, MiSs Le Fever, cried I, (who would not have interrupted her ?) to Save you the trouble oS Saying uncivil things. To See me at this junflure, I ■am very Sensible is no agreeable circumstance with you ; but I die Sor Some conversation with you; my busineSs is of the last importance, and you must indulge me.
She rang the bell; a dirty two-fisted wench made her appearance.
SuSan, Said she, (not in the Snappish manner in which she accosted me) do you wait in the next apartment until I call for you ; I have very particular reaibns for what I desire.
And do you put yourSelf upon your guard, madam. Said I, as the wench with-■drew ?
You must excuSe me, sir, returned she, very tartly, you have already tranfgreffed the bounds of good-breeding, and I am justified in every Sufpicion.
It is well, madam, extraordinary lessons may be learnt from even exceSs of deli-I 2	cacy,

(She gave me a heavenly glance) You know, continued I, you have treated me with great diSre- j SpeD, charged me with the grossest prac- j tiSes. Indeed, MiSs Le Fever, I cannot i sit down contented with unjust imputa- | tions.	I
You are a gentleman of very tender | feelings, (that ever the prettiest mouth in ! the world should be capable of Sneering)

My mother is from home ; your visit had certainly been better timed, if she could have participated it. I, however, must beg to know, what account I am to give of }^our proceedings when she does return.

Scorn and contempt would rouSe a Socrates : I am not naturally a madman, tho’ it is in your power to render me one ; and il you are determined to drive me to extremities, I hope you are prepared to anlwer for the conSequences.
Patience and resignation, my Lord, I believe, are virtues that you have but little acquaintance with ; and I should be equally Sorry to find mySelf engaged to prevent, as to anSwer for the extrava-

No, madam, exclaimed I, wsith great vehemence, I. will Spare no pains to diS-apeoint your romantic wishes : let the curate perform his drudgery, he wsill barely obtain lufficient to procure himSelf clean linen and a Scanty dinner.

That refieClion, my I.oist, is unwoitliy }^our charaSler. humanity inti rely out oS the question: that one part of the clergy lliould be wrapt in lawn, and the other cxpoSed to the greatest hardships, is an error in ecclesiastic res;ulations that ouerht to be reflisied. The dignity of that pro-fcshon extends to its meanest members; and tho’ the curate may feel distreSs, he must not deScend to industry for relief. To preach one day, <;nd labor the next, is denied him, notwithstanding he experiences miseries from the former, from which the latter would intirely extricate him. If it was not too great condescension, your Lordship might very Soon inform yourSelf, that the young fellow you have now though^; proper to deride, was not born to the contempt he must unhappily Sustain. How noble, how generous rrould it have been, for a youth of quality to have lifted Such a one from obScurity, to have countenanced his merit, assisted I 4	•	his

A Scheme instantly Suggested itSelS, (down on your knees, Arthur, and pray for its SucceSs) in conSequence oS which I made this unexpeOed reply.
All this, MiSs Le Fever, I am ready t© do on one concefficn, only let your connexion with him be dissolved, and I will obtain a cure for him that shall exceed his best exp^Xations, nor will I fail, upon any occasion, to be his warmest friend.
How, sir, demanded she,- will your friendship difplay itfelf only in disuniting us ; can you not be kind without being cruel; but we will owe no obligations to Such a heart.
And do you think he is, as heroic as yourfelf, madam, demanded I ? no. Mils Le Fever, lovely as you are, the charms of preferment would be too powerful for him to resist ; and he would forego his attachment to the one, to intitle himSelf to the other.

I 'will not prove an impediment.
There’s a girl for you !
Let us then, my dear madam, Said I, wave all animosities for the preSent, and join our forces to bring this young gentleman’s (I got it out, Arthur, with Some difficulty) affeftion to the test ; will you, wuite, or shall I ?.
It is a mortifying undertaking, returned " she, with a tender sigh; for if I am not greatly deceived, I shall only occasion him much afflidlion; and if I am, but I will write, my Lord, and you yourfelf shall be witneSs to the contents of my letter. .

To Mr. L E C E 1 S T E R.
Sir,
“ A.FRIEND of good Mrs. LeeSon’s, having heard of your merit and misfortunes, propofes to reward the one, and wipe out the memory of the other, by becoming your patron. It certainly is in his power to do great things for you, and it would be inconfistent with the friendship I bear you, not to promote your real interest,
“ But there is a condition that may perhaps rather startle you on a first view : all your expedatrons refpeding me must utterly terminate, if you accept of his offer. Yet Surely that is a light evil in comparison of many you now experience.

enee. Fortune is the key to every felicity ; and you may at Some future period rejoice in the diffolution of a conneflion, that would inevitably be pnodudlive of many inconveniences.
“ You must enquire no farther, but give me leave to affure you, my private approbation (no Small Support for your pride) will ever be yours: .1 have no other attachment in view : my heart is not quite So pliant as to be capable of receiving every impression my friends might chuSe to give it; nor will I judge So lightly of yours, as to SuppoSe you can forget me in an instant : it must be the work of time; and what is it that time cannot accomplish.
“You can have no notion of the advantages you will derive from this great man's favor; and the only disadvantage it v/ill expoSe you to, is the loSs of my correspondence, for my best wishes will ever be yours.

I cannot fay I am Satisfied with what she has wrote : there is a tender ambiguity that runs through the whole, that will work upon the Senfibility; but as she would not be perSuaded either to add or diminish one tittle, I was obliged to Submit; and have only the general c/mcN Spirit, and the loud demands of poverty to rely upon.
She folded it up, on my returning it into her hands. Sealed it, sighed a Second time, and begged the Savor of Jenny to convey it to the post. I could have wished to make Some additions and improvements, thoV I SuppoSe, shG Levite Vfould have betrayed me ; besides, I had no opportunity to give Jenny an item, and she had not the grace to re Serve it for my peruSal.
We now-chatted of indifferent things ; and as my behaviour was, to the last degree, distant and civilized, she did not aS-fume any airs. I could nevertheleSs perceive that the curate run dreadfully in her head ; but I hope he has fenfe, and I *	shall

stiall know how to deal with her I will anSwer for it.
When MrSi LeeSon returned, I begged to Speak with her in private, having first a very plausible excuSe for being found with the young lady.
Madam, Said I, affesting the prettiest" confusion imaginable, 1 fuppofe you may have observed how greatly I admire MiSs Le Fever, and I have too much principle to form dishonourable deSigna; but I ha\'e ’ reaSon to apprehend that even my most justifiable addresses would be rejeDed by her. A little parfon, you must know him, one Leceister, is the happy man, that is to bear away the prize; but she was Surely born for a ver}" different situation than the wretched one he would reduce her to; she deServes the utmost giSts of fortune.
Are you Serious, my Lord, returned Mrs. LeeSon ? can you really determine to marry a worthy young woman without one pecuniary recommendation ?

Some noblemen have Suffered ' them Selves to become unmindful of every consideration but perSon : that charge cannot, however, be brought against me in this instance ; Sor has not MiSs Le Fever the most exalted mdnd that ever woman poffeffed ? but you shall hear my plan. I will w'ait upon Lady Catherine Oldham, make her the compliment of consulting her, and perhaps she may, by this time, be ashamed of her conduD : and should she receive the worthy girl once more into her favor, many advantages might be derived Srom it.
It was very plain, Arthur, that Mrs.
LeeSon could have hugged me for my ingenuity ; she applauded, she promoted my defigti; and here am I at twelve o’clock at night, in my own apartment, with a positive reSolution to wait upon her Ladyship to-morrow morning.

What ra-ge., what turmoil, did it not occasion in his miserable breast ? he orders a, post-chaiSe immediately, tho’ perhaps with only six-pence in his pocket, and the next evening Sets him-down at the door of his beloved.
What a meeting ! Odhat he had but ab; that instant been lodged in the arms of the grimest of tyrants.

Jenny could remember very little more than that Mrs. Le Fever attended Mrs. LeeSon down stairs, in order to account for the pathetics she had been v/itneSs of, and the lovers were left to therafelves without interruption.
So you find, Arthur, I am at last become a pimp to the priest ; but he must oblige me in turn, and accompany you in Some little expedition.
When felf is at the bottom, how induS-trious it renders us. Poor Jenny, Jenny, is beyond meaSure afflisted, lest MiSs Le Fever will not marry my Lord, as her re-fufal would cut her out of her flattering expeflations of being my Ladfs woman.

Alas! sir. Said she, it is unfortunate that you should have fixed upon Such humble minds as ours : to gratitude we shall ever , be alive ; but there is no temptations that can rouSe us to ambition.

With a delicate mind, my Lord, replied this affecstionate mother, advice is controul, and perSuasion compulsion: you must excuSe me; I cannot run the hazard of ruining my child’s peace.

I had been compelled, as I informed you, to pafs one afternoon in his company, which was hardly enough fuS-tained, but I little fufpefled he would have So Soon repeated his visit.
My mother, Mrs. Leefon, and Mrs. Stubbs, having Some busineSs to draw them from home, (for to affist the indigent and relieve the distressed, they have all a peculiar turn) I intended to have devoted K 2	the
i
’n
196 T H E H I S TO RY O F	j
the hours of their abSenee to poor Mr.	|
Leceister : but beSore I could accommo-	|
date mySelS with proper materials for the	!
only conversation we could then enjoy,	j
who should enter my apartment, after a	j
flight familiar tap at the door, but the bold Lord Clerage.
Astonished at the rencounter, I believe I accosted him with very little ceremony i he fawned, I fretted; but as he insisted upon being heard a few words, I ordered Mrs. Stubb’s Servant to wait within call, as I have really too ill an opinion of him to trust mySelf one moment in his power : he raved at the indignity, but • was forced to Submit.
You cannot imagine how he treated me, made Mr. Leceister s circumstances his Sport, and at the long run insinuated, that as fond as he appeared of me, Set but a good living before him, and I should Soon find which would be most charming in his estimation ; offering to do many extraordinary things for him, if once he was un-conneDed with me.
I
Mjss LE FEVER 197
I almost diSpiSe mySelf for my folly ; for as Sure as you are alive, I was fo weak as to be piqued to fuch a degree, as to begin to think it very poffible that a pro-Spefl of advancement might have its allurements, and Suffered mySelf to be prevailed upon to propoSe the exchange to the greatly-injured young gentleman; for what can be a greater injury than entertaining unjust and ungenerous fufpicions of any one.
I wrote a most curious letter, my dear, tho’ it was daggers to my own heart; for to have been deferted by Mr. Leceister would have been the cruellest of all my misfortunes.
I was not inSensible of his Lordship's views for inciting me to fo strange a step ; but was pre-determined, if I found poor Leceister frail, never more to behold the face of man with approbation.
The letter was difpatched : two steepleSs nights and three anxious days did I experience. I concluded all was over; but K 3	would
j
198 The History of
would rather have died than betrayed my disappointment and affliDion.
The third evening however, my dear Polly, brought me a blessed evidence of my error; it brought me (it is the only exultation my heart ever felt) the amiable Leceister upon his knees before me to Solicit an explanation of Such bitter lines.
To See him was new life; but to See him So earnestly, So tenderly affeDed, was too much for me to Support, and for a few m oments deprived me of all Sensibility.
I Soon recovered, and Lord Clerage was a living proof how intirely the malicious defeat their ov/n purpoSes ; for never did I taste more flattering delight, than in the repeated assurances of Mr. Leceister s unalterable affedlion.
Nor will his ilhintended officioufneSs be produDive only of that single advantage. Mr, Leceister will not be prevailed upon to revisit the country, and each returning day will renew my happinefs.
But do not fuppofe his Lordship has
done
•or
Miss LE FEVER. 199
done with us; ]ie is still working on, tho’ with as little SucceSs as heretofore.
How endearing is my mother’s tender-neSs ? ah, my good girl, depend upon it few children would fly from the protection of reasonable parents, but what will not persecution hurry us into. We ought not to diSpoSe of ourSelves without the concurrence of tlieSe most valuable relations ; yet Surely no tie is Sufficient to engage us to Sacrifice our persons and inclinations, to gratify the humour or prejudice of any one.
This noble Lord has, it Seems, been tampering with the great Lady Catherine, who is ready to join hands with him to deprive me of every real SatisfaDion, and would palm their imaginary ones upon me : but I am not to be So easily taken in. I have been behind the Scenes, my girl, have viewed the puppets in their natural state, and never was there more emptj^, unprofitable, unSatisfied beings under the Sun, Seven thouSand pounds (methinks K 4	her

Your poor folks are So numerous and inconsiderable a body, that it is no matter how hastily or by what means they are diSpatched; but you and I are of another opinion, aiid Ixceister shall be our man of men.
I should be forry to be precipitated info an abrupt marriage : but to put a final period to the fchemes of my worst enemy Lord Clerage, I could be almost willing to tiy the evils of that condition that is ever extremes, extremely happy or extremely miserable.

Let me have your opinion, your advice, it is an unlucky accident; for I SuppoSe if even time should lessen the fenSe, without redressing the misfortune that now hangs , So heavy on this young lady's heart, I should never be permitted to make my appearance ; and all this becauSe I was unable to enter into the notion of the	i
people who had not bread to eat, bellowing for a painted baby : yet you will find he can live without her, tho’ his honour (youi half-starved heroes are most laughable chara6Iers) would not allow him to Say	i

Morning, lodClock.
STILL no Mr. Leceister! what will become of me ! restrained as I am from all complaint, no leSs by modesty than tender regard for the best of mother’s.
He has certainly met with Some accident, and perhaps languishes amongst Strangers, unable to acquaint them who he is. My dear mother is So humane to every creature in distreSs, that I need not doubt her concurrence to afsist him under any unhappy circumstances,

Lord Clerage to Sir George Hendon.
O Hendon, all covered as I am with guilt and affliflion, in what language shall I addreSs you. A villain may affish a villain may flatter, a villain may execute ; but it is to Such hearts as youi's alone, that 1 can fly Sor pity and conSola-tion.
I doubt not but your diScernment has anticipated my confession : the marks were strong upon me : why am I thus unable to Support either a just or baSe charaDer with uniformity ? I am unquestionably the most unhappy and abSurd of all compositions.
That I have been the direfl author of the calamity my Sweet woman So pathetically deplores, I need not Speak in plainer terms. To Save my Self from the last wretchednefs I was So mean as to enter into
bonds
2o8 The H i s t o r y of	I
bonds with the greatest oS monsters, who I has infinitely out-run my worst intention.
Take a deScriptioii, my friend, of the conSequences, but allow me forever to be silent reSpefting the particulars of the bafe tranfaflion.
I wns this morning in my study, my foul in a very uneafy state, when a Servant hastily informed me, that a young lady insisted upon Speaking with me. She Says your Lordship knows her well, added he, and her name is Le Fever. We would not permit her to alight without orders, especially as she appears wild and dejected.
Where is she, exclaimed the guilty wretch : shew me to her; ’tis I alone that can Speak peace to her poor wounded heart.
I found by the fellow’s countenance that my expreffions had furpriSed him, and w^as endeavouring to colle61; mySelf into Some kind of compoSure, during which short moment MiSs Le Fever had
pre-
Miss LE FEVER. 209
prevailed upon my people to admit her into the houSe, and she was immediately before my mortified eyes.
My Lord, Said she, on my knees, on my knees I conjure you to compaffionate my miSery, My reaSon is certainly shook —Mr. Leceister—releaSe him from his preSent situation, or your fins will be Spread out on the face of the earth. My mother and Mr. Leceister, I would die to preServe them; and here I voluntarily offer (if you can accept my peision under its grief and deformity) to comply with whatever terms you can propofe to obtain his liberty. I will never fee him but once again, just to Satisfy mySelf that he is not languishing out his existence for my tranS-gressions, and will then marry you, live ' with you, love and blest you.
Rife Mifs Le Fever, Said I, that Supplicating attitude ill-befits you. Whatever '
is in my powei ------
—O talk not of power, cried she, with the utmost earnestriefs, will you not Save
roe
2 10 The History of '
me from destruDion. Look on me, ray Lord, am I not the creature you So lately professed to admire ? will not Lady Catherine bestow Seven thouSand pounds to recommend me to your favour, tho" she would not part with a shilling to relieve my dying mother ? Take me, take me then, I will be the most obedient, the ten-derest of wives, only deliver that innocent Sufferer from bondage. I will not riSe, repeated she, (I had made many attempts, George, to raiSe her from fo unworthy a situation) I will not quit this fpot, until you assitre me Mr. Leceister shall be restored to liberty and his friends.
Indeed, MiSs Le Fever, returned I, I am grieved to my foul to behold you in this condition, eSpecially as I cannot relieve you from it. I could not confefs mySelf a villain, Hendon, but you can have no idea of my horror and remorfe.
My Lord, faid she, rivetting her eyes ' upon me, do you believe there is a God ? do not now deceive me, as you hope for
.mercy
Miss L E FEVER. 211
mercy at his hands ; for be assured, the cauSe of injured innocence will not go unpunished, nor the tears of wretched-neSs fail to prevail against you. I Sup-poSe you have So much humanity as to start at aSlual murder : your Sword that tvould relieve me from the bitterest of pangs, you could not lift up against me without shuddering. Yet you can behold the anguish of my foul unmoved; can ressecst upon the woes my widowed mother must endure, with barbarous resolution ; and steel your heart against the miserable complaints of a being you have So baSely trepanned.
Your pride, my Lord, your falSe SenSe of honour are still alive ; they at this very moment flush your cheek, and dart upon me from your eye ; and shall your humanity steep ? my accufation has called forth the one, oh let my miSery roufe the other. Your compaffion, your all-relieving compaffion, let it-revive in your breast, and rectify the evils you have occasioned.
212 The Historyof
I will forever haunt you with my intreaties, until I have Subdued your stubborn nature, and you conSent to give me back to tranquility and peace.
Only compoSe youisielf, my dear MiSs Le Fever, Said I, in the utmost distreSs, and I will endeavour—only compoSe yourSelf, (for she was again flying out) and I will Serve you. Permit me to Seat you ■—be Soothed—be Satisfied—you shall See him again, and I will no longer perSecute you. I will promote your union ; provide handSomely for him, and you shall live to bleSs the preSent objedl of your greatest detestation.
By degrees she lost the alarming fierce-neSs of her afpecl : her language became eaSy and intelligent; and I prevailed upon her to rest Satisfied that I would exert my utmost abilities in her Service.
And So I will, Sir George ; I am Scared with hobgoblins, and the most fristhtSul of chimeras.
But
Miss LE FEVER. 213
But should the young fellow, as I much apprehend, be far beyond my reach, I wonder who will be the greatest wretch, the injurer or the injured.
V	My heart tells me we are all undone;
my good inclinations, my honest resolutions, are come too late. Villain that I
I .	_	.
am, will heaven to chastiSe me, permit all theSe innocent people to be involved in one common ruin.
I know not where to find the vile executioner oS my vile purpoSes, nor have I the least clue to the finding out the young fellow. I know not how to proceed: but I fly, if poshble, to repair my crime : the attitude, the features, the wild, yet pathetic manner, of the distressed, the distrafled Le Fever, will never be out of my remembrance. Without doubt she loves this man, in the fame degree I love her.—— Perdition — but she must, she must be Saved; for I am not yet arrived at that

Sir George Hendon to Lord Clerage*
I Am glad, my Lord, to find that your Soul is not So uniformly bafe, as I began to believe it was. Your love for MiSs Le Fever, your little artifices to recommend youisielf to her favor, and your mortification at your ili-SucceSs, were all natural to your youth,

and the Sanguine disposition you are poS-Seffed of. But to overwhelm her with afflidlion, to hurry a young fellow into deSpair, and. tranSgreSs the laws both b“f humanity and your country, cast never be pardoned by either your friend, or your own heart, but upon ample compensation.
To bring back the injured fugitive, is t. duty you owe yourSelf, to wipe out the remembrance of the hoiTdr and miSery he must have endured, (by providing him a good living) essential to your future reputation with me: but in order to atone for jour glaring, your alfnost unequalled and adually capital offence, it is incumbent Upon you to promote that union, you have hitherto laboured to retard. That Spark of benevolence that still Subsists in your breast will prove the bane of all your enjoyments, unleSs you Satisfy its Just demands by the Costdud I now pfe-ieribe.
I am astonished^ that any conSideratidn cjjuid prevail upon you^ to call in So notorious
Miss LE FEVER. ^
torious and calloils-hearted a villain to your assistance as JohnSon, had he not Sufficiently evinced the corruption and cruelty of his nature on a late black oc • caSion.
1 hope yosir repentance is sincereS and will be found permaneiit—I would therefore Spare you as much as possible^ but I must forget I am a man, before I can refiedl; upon So-, atrocious an aftiori with temper, and ceaSe to be your friend, when I can forbear condemning and lamenting your share in it. Was it for this purpoSe, my Lord, that heaven called you to the possession of a plentiful fortune—can you conceive that your inteb ledlual faculties were bestowed upon you, ' only to enable you to demonstrate, that there is no monster like a human one ^
Do but once think upon the horror^ the anguish, you have prepared for your-Self, if you have put it beyond your power, to Speak peace where you alone have been the cruel Spoiler of it. To Sec B	f ho

the objed of your tenderest affedion j (whoSe principles might charm even devils into admiration) blasted at this blooming period by an unmerited calamity, which you are conScious was derived merely from yourSelf coistd it be endured ? do you imagine, as she strongly aSked you, that the cry of the widow will not prevail against you ; that yo,\ir proceedings against the innocent will fail to call .down yem gence upon your head ?
O ! sty to Save yourfelf from Such deep perdition, and plead the impetuosity of youth; the fatal influence of power, and the dire effeds of passion and immorality when let looSe but for a moment, if poS-fible to regain, and by degrees re-establish yourSelf in my late good opinion.
As to the hireling, the executioner of ypur unworthy wishes, he should most af-Isiredly be given up to public justice, if your fate was not So irrevocably con-neded. This is the‘Second time he has forfeited his neck—a Sum of money rer-
deemed
Miss LEFEVER. 5
deemed it before—but at what a price is he now Secured—Lord Cleragfs tainted honour is his happy protection.
Indeed, I am obliged to labour hard for you upon this occasion. RashneSs, inhumanity, and villainy, are a horrid compound—yet all thefe have predominated in a Soul, that I believed replete with valuable inclinations; and dashed with the fiightest tincture only of human frailty. I own, the education of young noblemen contributes largely to inSpire them with tyranny and preSumption; flattered for practices they ought to be ashamed of, and extolled for Sentiments that are utterly unworthy of them, they at length conceive they are to bear all before them. To be refuSed by an humble female, or rivaled b*y the man of limited expectations, is, perhaps, the last mortification they can Sustain: they will Subdue the poor creature, they fancy they love, to evince their arrogance, diSdains all bounds, and ruin the being they affeCt to deSpife B 3	to

to gratify their revenge: and having per- 1 formed adlions, for which a leSs noble villain would have Suffered the most ignominious punishment, meanly hide behind their title, and by a judicious distribution of their fortune rest Secure.
I shall be impatient to hear the SucceSs of what you promiSe to undertake, it is a nice and dangerous affair, and must not tranfpire — and shoifd you be enabled to shake off the weight of your iniquity by Leicester’s redemption, eompleat the work, by feeing them happily united.
You have given me a right to be as Severe, or what is equally as unpieaSant ' i to you, as Serious, as I pleaSe : and I will ! admonish you, that there is an hour approaching, in v/hich you will find more felicity in the bare recollection of having j aCled worthily, than all your idle purSuits could bestow, even in the instant of your I greatest enjoyment.
I shall not now Speak to many particulars that are yet unanfwered in your letter—.
Miss LE FEVER. 7
ter—but if by accomplishing what I trust is the wish of your heart, you render your-Self the instrument of returning happineSi to this deServing family ; I will make you Sensible of Such enormities in your intentions as well as aftual practice, as shall make you shudder at the retroSpe<5l of your danger, and inexpressibly rejoice in your great deliverance.
I am,
O Clerage, do I live to heSitate in Subscribing mySelf,

Leicester — the late formidable and happy Leicester—how shall I dare to tell i it—but he is my worthy friend, far, far	j
beyond all human relief, or rather has at- ! tained a miost glorious deliverance from injuries and persecutions.
The instant I had diSpatched my last letter, I stung mySelf into a chaiSe, and was.conveyed with all poffible expedition to JohnSon’s brothers in Kent. He had called there that very morning, and left them with a resolution to take a trip to France.
RemorSe astlidion, in conjunftion with this mortifying piece of information, quite ‘overcamie me; and I could only intreat them to Send a messenger expreSs after him, to recall him on the most important of occasions.
/ He was found at an inn in Dover, from whence I received the unexpected and heart-wounding intelligence that the poor fellow is no more.
And
Miss LE FEVER. 9
And is this the conSequence of all mj flattering Schemes—the injured Leicester has indeed most effedtually eScaped the toils of villainy and injustice—but tell me George, if innocence and virtue are the peculiar care of heaven : why was my Le Fever permitted to incur this most trying of calamities
I can never behold her more — O, let not death be hereafter esteemed a misfortune ; since it would prove the everlasting shelterer of the villain, as well as the mighty deliverer of the perfecutcd and oppressed.—To blow out my wretched brains would be an eaSy, pradticable, f tho’ deSperate adion: but to Sustain the complicated evils I have incurred—is the master-stroke of courage, and the Sublimity of resolution.
Yet I will live—difficult as the taste may be, I will encounter the tender Sorrow, the deep Searching reproaches of the Sweet ruined girl—I will Support her worthy mother—and if my whole fortune ^ B 5	could

could atone the error of my condud, how gladly would I resign it all.
To attempt to give you an idea of what I Suffer would be the height of abSurdi-ty—nor is your just refentment, your bitter condemnation, unfelt by the undone
Cleraoe.

I have concealed the fatal news in part from her knowledge.
O, Sir, cried she, miSs Le Fever will “ never Survive his loSs! I could almost “ break my heart to See her So wretched.’^
Had there been a means of recovering him—1 would have given Such proofs of my contrition and generosity, as must have Silenced not only the most rigid tongue of justice,, but induced you unre-
ludantly
Miss LE FEVER. ii
ludlantly to have received me to my wonted place in your esteem of friendship-—* for I would have vanquished—yes, George —your arguments should have had due weight—I would have vanquished even my own corrupt heart. Their union fiiould have been the darling object of my attention—their comfortable provision my whole care, and, to compleat the affair, I would have bestowed the precious girl according to her wishes with my own hand—and a perpetual amity should have Subsisted amongst us. But now, what is in -my power but unavailing sighs and end-leSs confuSion!
Restored to new life—Leicester is not’ only in Safe, but recoverable circumstances—the wretch that tranSadled the infamous buSineSs, had the cruelty to rm-poSe the falsehood of his death upo'n me, in order to prevent my generous purpoSe of giving him back to liberty, and his Le Fever.

Sir George, you must not be Surprised, if the world should pick a lesson of in-strudtion, and be furnished with a tale of wretchedneSs, at the expence of your once Jiappy friend.
Yet I will proceed with the utmost caution, and, if it be possible, avoid every other condemnation than thoSe of friendship and conscience.
How shall I get him conveyed from Hogfden ? I believe 1 mySelf must go down,—‘ I should not wonder if defpair and ill treatment should have rendered him as frantic, as the worst patient in the liouSe.
Adieu, George, and allow me, in re-fpedt of my repentance for this time, to add my uSual conclusion of,

SO, iny Lord, I find that the very Service 1 have rendered you, at the hazard of my neck, has excluded me from your favor: but however you may feel yourfelf diSpoSed towards me in your present penitential sit—let me conjure you to pay proper attention to yourSelf.
Was ever Inch romantic nonSenSe heard of—the Lady has offered herlelf to your acceptance, you Say, (the very purpoSe for which you incited me to turn knave,.) and yet, like a whining School-boy, you will part with your Sweet-meats to. patch up your reputation, and cry for them all the rest of your days.
Besides, what opinion do you think the Lady must entertain of both your gallantry and love ? RefuSe her—cast her off—force her upon another —and in the very moment too, when she has an opportunity
(and

(and is most Sensibly diSpoSed to embrace it,) to become Lady Clerage—and Secure her Self from all blame.—It is to purchaSe his liberty that she now conScnts—not ta gratify any little vanity, ambition, or fickle inclination, that will be bufy in the human heart.
Not to dwell, however, upon what you may call conjeftural motives^ let u^ return to your own feelings.
Remember, my Lord, before it is too late, that Sir George Hendon, with all his heroics, could but poorly Support your languishment when she is irretrievably lost. Have you once considered, what it is to know the objedt of your dearest affedlions in the poffeshon of your rival, and Such a rival.—O dignity, O reSolu-lution, where are ye fled !
Have 1 not frequently heard you prove, that your heroes, of every denomination, are but a tame kind of madmen.---Ge-

' You cannot upon this occasion fulpedt me of interestedneSs—what advantage should I derive from your happineSs— taking me in my villainous, my unSocial charadier: but how far Soever I may have been drawn from the letter of integrity^— love, was my first Seducer, (a passion whoSe influence you are no stranger to,)

Lord Clerage to Arthur Johnson’,
Y" E S, JohnSon, yo» well know the way to my heart, and I take shame to myfelf, for having divided a fault with you, that was wholly my own. You have, my friend, awakened me to a due SenSe of that happineSs that now awaits my ac-* ceptance, and Sir George’s pen is exer-cifed in vain.
A letter, I Suppofe of honest exhortation, lies at this moment on the table before me unopened.—I will not be warped from my purpofe, I will not be deluded from the delightful path I have attained.— ‘ My Le Fever’s lips have pronounced the happy invitation, nor will I fail to make one more grand push, to accomplish what I have fo long Sighed for.
But, Arthur, you ought not to have tgken fuch cruel steps with reSpedl to poor

My Le Fever, Arthur, for are you not my witneSs, that I have paid the stipulated price.
“ Deliver, Mr. Leicester, Said she, from “ the miserable state to which he is now “ reducedand if yo-u can accept oI me,. (charming creature, my own foul is not a more valuable possession) “ I will marry you, live with you, love and bleSs you.’*
That I was SurpriSed by an ugly concatenation of circumstances at that period, into Such over-strained generosity, that I declined what I would almost die to obtain, I cannot deny; nay, I madly promised to promote, what I beyond measure abhor.—But when I recoiled how* deSperate an appearance matters bore

My amiable girl half distradled—the priest out of my reach, it was my interest to Sooth, to flatter, to conSole her—-but as the Scene is So happily changed, and the propoSed terms So perfectly corn” plied with—it is impossible to adhere-— in short, Arthur, we will talk no more of it.
If this miserable thread of the linen vejiment of Azaa had never fallen in my Le Fever’s way, I had now been in possession of the highest bliSs, and the approved friend of Sir George Hendon. Instead of which, I am involved in an .ocean of mortification and perplexity.

Muffied up in my great coat, I enquired for Mrs. Stubs, and was shewn into her apartment agreeable to my wishes.
Madam^ Said I, to the forbiding countenanced (tho’ truly good-natured woman)	|
I would Speak with MiSs Le Fever in your parlor, if you will pleaSe to permit me—
I have news for her that will be highly grateful, but miust be communicated in private.
It is not for me, my Lord, returned she, to comment either upon your present request, or late behaviour: my parlor, I do assure you, is much at your Service, if the young Lady has no objedion to your propoSal.
She will not—she cannot. Madam, cried I a little impatiently, if you only make herproperly acquainted with it—SuSpicious
and
Miss LE FEVER. 21
snd officious fool, added I, when she had shut the door after her; what bright ap^ prehension can now have Seized there ?
The dear creature guessed my buSineSsji and stew down in an instant.
Have my prayers been heard, my Lord, cried she, the moment she beheld me, is my most anxious wish accomplished ?
Mr. Leicester, Madam, returned I, is both Safe and well (in theSe cafes, Arthur, it is not necessary to keep stridtly to the truth) and will be in town this very evening.
Her joy-^well Leicester, was the ob-Je£t of that you know. But I cannot Say her gratitude quite anSwered my cxpedla-tions—she Seemed to regarcl my condudl, as mere matter of atonement.
I Said a vast deal, in order to convince her that I had no hand in his kidnapping—* but in Spite of all my rhetoric, I could perceive strong traces of incredulity in her countenance. She was however So gracious, as to yield to my intretaies, to
conceal

conceal the cruel Suspicions she was pleaS-ed to entertain of me from her favourite; tho’, i am afraid, there was much more consideration for him than your humble Servant, even in that conceffion.
I was, you may be Sure, very impatient to kriow what I had to depend upon— but to introduce the important Subjeft; 'required much addreSs and delicacy.
I think. Madam, Said I, I have heard you Say Mr. Leicester is unprovided for.
1 am Sorry, it is not at preSent in my power to evince the Sincerity of my incli-^	j
station to Serve him. A friend of mind indeed is lately dead; wsho poffeffed the perpetual advowSost of a living, Somewhat about three hundered pounds a year. I know the family have not yet intrusted the temporary poffessioh of it to any one, and that I could immediately procure it for your friend; but then it is not the certainty I Could wish, as there is a Son now almost eighteen, who will perhaps require the resignation, So Soon as he h duly qualified—>

I dare believe. Sir, Said she with visible pleaSu re, that Mr. Leicester would be extremely glad to accept of your Lord-ship’s patronage and protedion : he h^s both an honest, and a grateful heart—and is he will be ignorant of the quarter froni whence his ihjuries—-

You have Seen the fairest Sky obfcured by dark heavy clouds—you have Seen— but nothing can give you an idea of the change the Se words produced in the most lovely of features. ^
I acknowledge, my Lordj Said she; you have the advantage of me—that I made you the extravagant offer of my hand and perSon I will not attempt to deny, nor; li.you can Submit to demand them, shall they be withheld. It would be to very little purpoSe I am convinced, to remind you of your profeshons upon that shocking occasion—how you disclaimed the Sacrifice, the—but I have done, and will abide by-your determination—as I forelee it is the only means of Securing that worthy, unfortunate, young gentleman, from farther violence—and henceforth—i her Sweet mouth, Arthur was a little con-

WLilSed from the stubbornneSs of her heart —I will be only yours.
I kissed her hand, and played a thousand rapturous pranks winch 1 was unable to restrain : nor did I once reSent (tho’ I Sensibly felt the ungracious stroke) her bold acknowledgment, that it was for the parSon’s fake alone she conSented to be mine.
One thing howeTer, my Lord, reSuin-ed she, I have to premiSe—1 will not abruptly break off with my unhappy friend —he shall be Settled in the country-weaned from me by degrees—and I will endeavour, in the mean time,todetatch my affedlions as much as possible from him—■ to Save mySelf from the most horrid of perjuries.

Ishave obtained leave to repeat my visit So Soon as I pleaSe, and we are to concert the most plausible me^lSures for reconciling Leicester to our Suture views and intentions.

Mifs L E F E V E R to Mifs Winter,
Did I not mention to you, my dear Polly, on Some former occasion, that I was not of the number of thofe, who conceive themSelves marked out by providence for peculiar wretchedneSs—but alas! that confidence has nearly forSakeil me—I am not in any degree equal to the trials I am called to fustate» and, without Supernatural assistance, must sink under them.
I concluded my last letter in the frenzy of deSpair: but it was not even then, at its utmost height ; for, would you believe it, all mild and timid as I am by nature-— I flew to the well known author of my miSery, and offered to Sacrifice mySelf for Leicester’s redemption.
That villainy and humanity can exist in the Same boSom—but, however great the Seeming contradidion, in Lord Clerage’s C 2	cafe.

cafe, at that period it was most incon-testibly evident. My appearance struck him with horror, and my language Searched him into contrition.
He for Some time uSed his artful endeavours to conSole me, without making the concession my heart was Set upon-—but finding all he Said only aggravated my shfferings, he was at last So intirely overcome, that he gave me the strongest assurances, that my wishes should be accomplished, and has adually been indefati-cable in efieding this humane engagement.
But by relieving me on the one stand, he has destroyed me on the other.
His goodneSs, his mercy, his benevolence, my Dear, are merely transient: and as he no longer beholds me in the deplorT able agonies that shook his daring resolution—-he already begins to deceive him-Self with the preposterous expectation, that jabSence will wear out the favourable inv
pression^
Miss LE FEVER. 29
pressions I have received of Mr. Leicester’s merit.
On this fatal preSumption, on this ab-Surd hope, or more properly from the ir-' restrainableneSs bf his own disposition, which he miScalls love—he has had the meanneSs, the cruelty, to wave his own generous professions, and demand the performance of mine—that were alone extorted by miSery and anguish.
But I will be resigned—bitter and grievous as the compliance will prove to my foul, I am reSolvcd to carry it into execution—it is the only method, my dear Polly, (tho* you must confeSs a very delperate one,) to preServe the man I love from injustice and persecution. By this exalted stroke of female heroiSm, (for Such you must allow me to call it,) my poor mother’s circumstances will be rendered eaSy, Lady Catherine’s fickle friendship restored—your Le Fever’s head adorned with jewels, her steps lurrounded with macnincence—and whilst all thefe C 3	externals
30 The History of
externals flatter her beholding friends— may they never have one Sad idea of the wretchedneSs that will corrode her miserable heart.
His want of delicacy, his breach of generosity, almost distracts me—is there in nature Such horrid SeififlineSs—can any human being exult in the poffeffion of the rnere covering of a broken and dejedled Spirit.? Mr. Leicester—how will he Support the no leSs unexpeded than unjustifiable treatment ? I shall See him once more, however—and we will look no further at preSenr—the proSpect is abundantly too dreadful to be dwelt upon.
Neither my mother, nor Mrs. LeeSon, have the most distant apprehension of his. Lordship’s villainy—nor durst I venture to give them any intimation of it, for fear of incurring the fuSpicion of vanity and ingratitude, So that he will at this day have the merit with them, of being his great and noble deliverer. And as things are likely to take the melancholy turn,
I have
'Miss LE FEVER. st
I have described, it will be most prudent for me to remain for ever Silent, rdpedt* ing the whole tranSa£Uon.
Is there no way of eScaping this last, this greatest evil
I have just communicated the good news, this Lord has brought me with regard to poor Mr. Leicester, to my best friends. They congratulated me with the utmost warmth—professed to participate nly returning happineSs, and I was obliged to sink my depression deep, to elude their penetration. They perfeftly defied this strange man of quality for his humanity, . his difinteressedneSs, his greatncSs of Sou! — for was it not a rival, an approved as Suc_ ceSsful rival, that he had been the instrument of restoring, to the utter exclusion of liimSelf and every shaddow of hope— but the felicity of the woman he loved, was apparently much dearer to him thari his own.
Specious, barbarous, irrefolute mortal—can 1 deliver mySelf up—yet what is C 4	the

The HistORyoF
the peace of a mere individual, to the convenience, the Satisfadlion of a multitude—my mother—the already too much injured Leicester, are deServing of the prodigious Sacrifice, and I will not complain.
I must, my dear girl, (even while I confeSs that I believe you incapable of Such cruel inSult,) I must caution you never to mention the title, fortune, or other fatal acquisition I may obtain, with the Smallest degree of approbation—they will be only So many stabs to my bleedings Suffering, heart—from their proving continual mementos of that calm, that blessed tranquillity, Leicester, and a bare competence would have given me.
I hope to See him to-morrow,—Adieu, my good girl—I fly the cruel recolledtion, that we are only to meet this once, to forever Separated.

Sibility. Thus the best institutions may be perverted to the vilest purpoSes.
An ill-looking fellow, with a miSerable taper, was my gentleman usher to a roorn that had a gloomy appearance, which was unSpeakably heightened by the objedt it contained.
Pale, faint, and with every token ot the bitterest deSpair, lay the poor Suffering Leicester—stretched out at his length ■ on an old dirty mattreSs—his feet were fastened down with cords, and his hands strongly fettered.
His fixed features underwent not-the-least change on my approach—intirely hopelefs what was worth his observation.
Sir, Said I, with ail the tender pity that -was due to his condition, you must not'- , be Surprised to find a friend in your extremity I know your story, and have received authority on one conceshon to restore you to all you hold dear.
It is too late, replied he in a weak, low, voice-—my faculties are all exhausted—

pieces—and relieved him from that bond-	1
age that I shuddered, only to behold.	'

He darted his ghastly eyes upon me—I was obliged to repeat the flattering assurance, and as belief began to steal upon his heart, his features assumed a more placid cast.—— But, Sir, reSumed I, there is one condition that I am bound to pro-pofe.
Make your own terms, cried he, every thing but MiSs Le Fever, (what will become of me, JohnSon?) who is infinitely dearer to me than life itSelf, shall be yours.
It is not to be expeded, returned I, that you should not feel the utmost horror and reSentment at the treatment you have Sustained. But can you accept of the Services I mean to render you as a full compensation : and whilst you bleSs your deliverer, forbear to complain of your betrayer : 1 have reafons for this request.

We returned to London. Our conversation on the road was Such as might be expefted—he is very happy in his expressions, tho’, at preSent, a kind of hor»-rid Spedtacle to the sight. I Set him down at the houSe I had prepared for his reception, and I have great reaSon to believe	(

ther weak—recolledlion is painful to me—but I shall recover by her conversation, and revive by her tenderneSs.
You shall take a chair. Sir, Said I, and I will go before and prepare MiSs Le Fever for your arrival. I accordingly hurried away to Mrs. LeeSon’s, and begged to Speak once more with the young Lady in private.
She appeared.
I informed her, Leicester was on his way to Mount-street, and beSought her to conduft herSelf with her uSual reSolution,
She trembled—she was greatly agitated. You will be preSent, Sir, Saidshe^— I have given you a right to request what I thus voluntarily offer—our private meetings must now terminate for ever.
O ! how was my foolish, fond, believing heart tranSported by this unexpedted piece of condeScention—but before I could reply—Leicester was at the door.
It was torture, it was distradiOn—but could not be avoided—»-he retained her
hand

hand after the most tender and affedliorf-

nefs to.
I, am now completely Satisfied, cried he, and let the memory of what is past perish for ever. The ruffians that betrayed me, managed very dexteroussy ♦ for if 1 was diSpoSed to proclaim my wrongs, (there is comfort for us culprits)
I should be utterly unable to fix them—■ but it was the condition on vrhich I obtained my deliverance, never to complain ; and as 1 have been So short a time abSent, and m) connexions in London So	|
limitted, it will be no difficult matter to	j
hush up the whole affair.
I hope. Sir, Said MiSs Le Fever, that your Sufferings are all at an end—that gentleman has a propoSal to make to you, that cannot but be agreeable.
Tire living was then brought u pon tjie carpet—he was perfe(5lly transported.
O ! Sir, exclaimed he—what unhoped for felicity have you conferred upon me—
You,

You, Madam, will not Surely refuSe to augment, to participate the blessing. If , you ever entertained a favourable opinion of me, if you ever intended to honour me with your hand, do not now with-hold it—help me. Sir, assist me with your generous eloquence to obtain this greatest, this most essential of points, and never was there a being more completely hap-, py, than I should be rendered.
This, you are Sensible, must be a very delightSul turn and request to me.
MiSs Le Fever’s countenance v/as instantly over Spread with tjie deepest anguish ; and she was Seized with a strong and most alarming fit, I think they call it convulsive.
Leicester, the horrid looking, the officious Leicester, held her in his arms—I fetched in Mrs. Stubbs—Jenny happened very fortunately to be below—and we all at length, with great difficulty, brought her to herSelf.
She
44 The Historv or
She desired Leicester, So Soon as she	^
was Somewhat recovered, to go up to her mother and Mrs. LeeSon, as they wanted much to See him, promising to follow in a short time; but charged him on no consideration to alarm them with the mention of her diSordef.
The moment Leicester retired, she in-treated to Speak with me alone.
My Lord, Said she, I find I have entered into an engagement, I am unable to perform—you have beheld the dreadful effedls of constraint upon my constitution, and I would die in silence, if I had not the tenderest of mothers to claim my attention. Let me beSeech you. Sir, before it is too late, to consider what miSe-ry, what wretchedneSs, you would be the author of, by persisting in your preSent purpoSe. My early death, (which would, infallibly be the caSe,) would be the least part of what you would have to anSwer for.—My mother, Mr. Leicester, would not their unmerited Sufferings be duly
punished.

I behold you at preSent with horror and detestation; I cannot conquer them, nor shall the acknowledgment be any longer Suppressed; but you have k in your power to intitle your Self to my thanks, my gratitude, my best approbation.

Live, live, my beloved MiSs Le Fever, cried I, with the tenderest emphasis, live and be happy. I now abSolve you from every hateful tie. The temporary living shall be Mr. Leicester’s—and do you fulfill (it stuck in my throat notwithstanding all my contrition,) his utmost

And now, Mr. JohnSon, I leave you to judge, if all correspondence between you and me must not terminate. I cannot brook raillery, and you are incapable of beholding my condudt in any other than a ridiculous light.

NOW, now, my worthy Hendon, you may rely upon Seeing me— every thing is as you could wish—the confiid over, and London beyond my utmost view,
I have taken my leave, perhaps for ever, of every vain purSuit: I have bid adieu to the pleaSures of gaiety, and the .delights of revelling: I have washed my hands of iniquity : I have torn mySelf from the Spot I doated upon:—I have resigned Such hopes I have fore-gone Such ex-pedlations—but what is it I have not left behind me, except the cuisie of conSciouS-neSs, and the racks of fenSibility. Well, west, am I not in the high road to Dunstable, and shall I not proceed from thence to Sir George Hendon’s —Does not the most friendly reception—the most humane' attention, and every rational amuSement,

await me ? Lady Hendon—but my wounds	|
will bleed afresh when I behold her—her Sex, her perfedtions—the domestic hap-pinefs she communicates, are very unfit encounters for a man in my circumstances. I must have an apartment, m.y friend, that will Seclude me from every female—and you, and you only, will be my welcome visitant.
Yet I am determined if possible to tear her lovely image from my heart—I will enjoy the beauty, the innocence of your rural world ; and be the Damon and Cor-	|
rydon of the village.	i
And can I then forget the Abbey ad*-venturer—there, alas, is the rock on	|
which my miserable peace will be per-	|
petually Splitting. What a countenance—^ how justly and strongly was the Soul de-picsted in each glowing feature. Yet what a contemptible wretch, to be whining for the only woman, perhaps, that would have disdained my addresses. Am I not young ? Do I not poffeSs uncommon advantages,

vantages, fortune, title, vivacity; and we will look about us, Hendon, and not only divert, but diSpel this troubleSome paS-Sion. Has not the gentle Romeo fre-r quently excited our mirth ? the dying Va-zanees our ridicule ? and shall we not rally our modern Enamorato out of his languishments ?
That there has been puppies in every century, is evident, no leSs from the lightest, than the Soberest page. The witchcraft of love, was not at all times resistible, even with heroes. Senators, and great philoSophers—and yet I am very much inclined to believe, that none of your ladies, in ancient story, ever equalled my Le Fever.

From the Same to the Same.
Brickle Y.
Your congratulations, my dear girl, were highly grateful to me. My Spirits were So diScompoSed by the important change in my condition, that my mother kindly offered her Service to make you acquainted with it
Our parting with the worthy Mrs. Lee-Son and Mrs. Stubbs, Sat heavy upon my heart for Some time; but the Smiling Sa-tisfadlion that shone forth in my mother’s aSpeft, So much Superior to all I could have expe^ed, gradually harmoniSed my Soul, and communicated the most flattering and delightful of hopes. She is desirous, I do affure you, of an opportunity of presenting her new and approved relation, to his old friend MiSs Winter; I therefore intreat you will let us See you * Neither of which letters are inferred.
D 3	as
54 TheHistorvof
as Soon as possible, and that in the mean time, you will be abundantly careful of yourSelf for-our fakes.
Your father’s diSorder may continue for many months; to leave him, I own would be unnatural; but should any change take place, you Surely would not think of living at Such a cruel distance from us.
Our habitation is large and commodious—and its Situation to the last degree unexceptionable. My mother is natu-^ rally chearful—-my huSoand’s disposition YOU are no stranger to; and when you add your Sincere friend to the company, can you not conceive, that we inight derive unSpeakable felicity from our union. I will not, however, enter into a description of the conveniency and advantages v/e are possessed of, lest you should be tempted to call my veracity in question; to exaggerate beauties, and aggravate deformities, is no uncommon practice, where interest or prejudice governs i	the
Miss LE FEVER. 55
the pen; you shall visit us, my girl, and judge for yourSelf.
Sometimes, indeed, vrhen I look forward to the precariouSneSs of our preSent possessions, I am shocked and alarmed. But Mrs. LeeSon affures us of our Safety in Such positive terms, that Mr. Leicester and my mother are entirely undoubting.
It is plain, my Polly, that this Lord Clerage is capable ofboth cruelty and injustice, yet we must nevertheless acknowledge, that he is no Stranger to generoSi-ty and humanity; great were the evils he brought upon us, but has he not madje us all possible recompence.
I own, when I restedl: upon Lady Catharine’s condudl, his Lordship’s loSes a large portion of its enormity in my estimation, He had a gratification to ob* tain—her Ladyship’s rigor and inflexibility—what could they proceed from ?
Did site not consign me to danger and Suffering,- upon the siightest offence— D 4	her
The Historv of’
her Sex alone might have taught her a more tender lesson. Had I renounced her protedHon for Mr. Leicester’s Sake ; had I proved ungrateful, or preSuming upon her indulgence, I should have acquitted her of all blame—but I only fought to relieve the miSery of So near and dear a relation, as not to have loved, compassionated, and assisted, would have betrayed me, unworthy even of life it-Self, and devoid of all Sensibility.
This was my tranSgression, and you are well acquainted with my punishment: yet this very woman So outrageous, So mercileSs in her reSentment, could, from pride, offer to bestow upon this highly offending objedt, Seven thouSand pounds to recommend her to nobility. Yes, Seven thouSand pounds were ready to intitle her to a Superfluous Settlement; but not one farthing to have preferved her from vice or penury.
It is all past, however, and should be forgotten; but the too retentive and feel-
ing
Miss LE FEVER. 57
ing foul will not always rest—and there are hours, in which the cruel Scene of being driven out by her Ladyship, Suggests itSelf So strongly to my imagination, that I am unable to restrain all thoSc paS-sions, it sirst gave riSe to.
What providence means to do with us, is an anxious, tho’ preSumptuous enquiry; I am Sensible every situation has its uncertainty, but the loSs of our provision is not only a very possible, but a very probable contingence. 1 know my own strength of mind, but have reaSon to apprehend, that poor Mr. Leicester is not altogether So well Suited to the exerciSe of adversity—and what pangs should I endure upon his, and my dear mother’s account.—O Polly come, and Save me from theSe embittering restedtions.
This is rather an uncommon stile fora bride—a happy bride, as I may most justly call mySelf; but there is Such a mixture of good and evil, of joy and grief, D 5	in
58 TheHistoryof
in my destiny, that 1 know not which ought to be most predominant.
Lord Clerage left London, they tell me, in great difcontent, (thefe young gentlemen—how ill they broke the fiight-est disappointment,) and professes to Suffer much more for my Sake, than I flatter mySelf is literally true. May he find that felicity in his future connexions, he has had the justice to bestow on me.
Mrs. LeeSon has made me a preSent of a handSome piece of plate, and promiSes to favour us with her company in the country, if she lives till next Summer—a very precarious dependance at her time of life—tho’ indeed, it is the cafe with reSpect to all human dependances, ex--cept where the heart and affeftions are as strongly united, as are thoSe of my dear Polly’s and her,

Letter XIII.
Lord Clerage to Sir George Hendow.
FOrgive me, my ever valuable George, and you, my obliging Lady Hendon, that I have made So unworthy a return for all your kindneSs, as to elope from your indulgent and hofpitable roof; madly to launch a Second time on that great ocean, the world.
Had I followed the didlates either of right reaSon, or your friendly adviSe, I am Sensible I should still have shunned the dangerous encounter; but let your apprehensions, your tender concern for me, wholly Subside, and be affured I am utterly unv/orthy both of the one and the other.
. D si	'I will
I
6o The Historv of
I will tear off the maSk, for it is become beyond meaSure intolerable, and difcloSe Some blameable particulars which I have had the mean artifice, even in my hours of confeshon, to conceal from your knowledge.
You may remember, that when my disappointments drove me from London, I Sent you word from St. Alban’s, that I intended to make your houSe my happy affylum.
At that period. Sir George, I rather deceived mySelf, than you: it was my intention, it w'as .my reSolution—but I had no Sooner diSpatched my unmeaning, incoherent letter, than all the fury I had So long endeavoured to SuppreSs, burst forth, and I became but one remove from an absolute lunatic.
What have I done, cried I, abandoned my last, my dearest hopes—it cannot be—1 will indeed, never more call in a villain to my assistance—but 1 cannot leave her So abruptly. I will diSguiSe mySelf—I
will
Miss LE FEVER. 6i
will watch all their motions—shall I patiently endure the racks and tortures of a wounded Spirit, whilst they are revelling in the exceSs of felicity. No, this head of hair (viewing mySelfin theglaSs,) shall no longer distinguish me from the most Sober race of mortals—a wig will favour my wishes, consequently is a most desirable acquisition.
I immediately Sought out a miSerable barber—underwent the operation—purchased a little demure bob—and without the least precaution to prevent my taking cold, returned in a few hours to London.
1 wrote to you with dissembled com-pofure; in order to amuSe you with a notion, that I had called at Clark’s, (our old School-fellow,y and told you, I would be with you within the fortnight.
I had formed a variety of Schemes, to introduce mySelf at Mrs. LeeSon’s, nor do I know what miSchief I might have effedted, if I had been permitted to carry any one of them into execution. But the
loSs
62 The Historv of
loSs of my hair gave me So Severe a cold, that I verily believed I should have lost my eyes—it, however. Soon shewed itSelf to be a St. Anthony’s fire, and Settled on one side of my face.
When I found It necessary to put my-felf under the care of Some experienced perfon, I Sent for Dr. Broadwater, with whom I recolledled your worthy and Sedate countryman. Freeman, was then a pupil.
He gave me good attention, treated my disorder judicioussy, but the rednels on my cheek did not wear off for Some time after I arrived at your feat—I forget what falSe reaSon I theft assigned for it.
I gave mySelf to the doDor for a decent private man, of Some little property ; and contrived to have frequent conversations on various Subjedls with Freeman, in the courSe of which I discovered, that he was possessed of every requisite for my purpoSe.
1, at
Miss LE FEVER. 63
I, at length, took an opportunity of enquiring into his circumstances, and found them limited and unpromising to my heart’s content. For he had no view, beyond engaging himSelf as an assistant to Some one of the faculty in the army or navy. I cast about for many days, yet was unable to hit upon any plausible method of rendering him Serviceable to me—when it struck my whimsical fancy, that to fix him at Brickley, in his own profession of an apothecary, might be a lucky article.
I would gladly have given my Self to him as a partner, and, let me tell you, many partnerships have been patched up on no better foundation—I the money, be the shill, but was afraid of detection. Nor is there a more convenient character under the Sun, for running in and out a houSe unquestioned,, than the phySi-cian. Surgeon, or apothecary. The first, I was most SenSible, was a stroke or two too high for Brickley, and the Second no
leSs
\
64 TheHistorvof
leSs Superior to the abilities I was master of; for to affume a consequential look, and Set a broken bone, is not equally pradticable.
The humble apothecary was a Sphere,
I think, I should have ventured to have moved in, if my knowledge of your country customs, had not convinced me of the neceffity of uniting the Several branch- . es, when at a distance from the metro* posts. I therefore wiSely determined he should embark alone, and that I would visit him at Some future period, as a friend, boarder, or whatever would wear the best face of probability.
I accordingly obServed to him one day, what a pity it was, he should leave England ; and, as if by accident, described the many advantages that would accrue from his Settling in Some little town— and having mentioned two or three places, with the addreSs you know I am capable of, dwelt boldly upon Brickley, as the most eligible—offered to be his friend—-
and
M I s s L E F E V E R. 65
and Sent him down at my own expence , to reconnoitre.
Every thing Succeeded to my wish—a reputable perSon of the faculty v/as greatly wanted, as the man who at that period, from necessity was their every thing, was little better than a horSe dodtor.
I advanced him five hundred pounds upon his own bond—a houSe vras taken— the modest furniture Soon conveyed into their reSpedlive places, and Freeman, with a most grateSul and honest heart, strutting behind his counter.
As the fellow I have just mentioned, was the only apothecary v:ithin Several miles of Brickley, he was pleaSed to add, -to his other perfedlions, all that inSolent, low conSequence, Such a circumstance naturally communicates to your narrow Souls—So that you find our Freeman Set off with a very favourable proSpedt—nor did I Scruple to pronounce, that if his Soft addrefs, agreeable perSon, tender application, and indefatigable industry, failed
66 The Historv of
ed to recommend and establish him, (Sup^ ported, as I reSolved he should be by me, in that essential particular, money) he must be the most unfortunate of be-ings.
When this matter was perfeftly accomplished, I arrived at your Seat, where I m.ust acknowledge, I have with difficulty detained mySelf, (notwithstanding the goodneSs of both Lady Hendon and yourSelf) for two whole years, during which time, Freeman and 1 have been constant correspondents.
He informed me of repeated additions to Mrs. Leicester’s family, a boy and girl; that Mrs. LeeSon.had stood in person to the former, (who it Seems is my name-Sake) to the latter by proxy only.
He has been SucceSsful even beyond my utmost expeflations ; for within theSe Six weeks, Mifs Winter, (the Lady whoSe letter I intercepted, and Sent my baSe engine a copy of, at the breaking out of my disappointments, and who, upon the
death
Miss LE FEVER. 67
death of an old croSs father, came to reside intirely with her friend, Mrs. Leicester, J has thought proper to bestow her hand upon him, with a fortune of nine thouSand pounds.
The Small Sum I lent him, has been repaid with the utmost gratitude, and I have received repeated invitations, both from himSelf and wife, (by the name of Clayton, and the diredlion of the letter being left at your post-houSe till called for,) to favour them with my company— an invitation, I have had the grace, till within theSe few days, to decline.
But what is now become of all my resolution—and have I at last most fatally retraded my renunciation of this charming woman ? I have, George, heard Such particulars, as mustjustify the flame that has been awakened in my Soul, and plead my excuSe for every future proceeding.
You must allow. Sir George Hendon, . that ifMiSsLe Fever was under no obligations
68 TheHistorvof
gations to me, I was not in any degree o-bliged to MiSs Le Fever; but what can be Said for a wretch—who having receiv- ' ed the most precious of giSts—can be unkind to the giver—and entertain the grossest Suspicions of her, that is little inferior to the angels themSelves, in purity and virtue.
Why, why would this reptile teach Such a wife an evil lesson against him-Self—and will she not attend to it—she indeed Spurned me, when 1 offered to raiSe her to the highest dignities—but may she not be rouSed by ill treatment, to make me the instrument of her revenge—it is at least worth the experiment, and shall be carried into execution.
Have patience with me, my friend, and do not compel me to Seek a lest, wemhy considant—I will write you every thought of my heart, however odious or reprov-able, and Submit to your chastiSement without complaint. Be Satisfied that baSe-
neSs,
Miss LE FEVER. %
neSs, that guilt dwells only on my pen. So long as I continue to correSpond with you. Accept this as my final apology, and allow me to rattle on in the language of a knave, to Secure me an honest man.
A beautiful dejedtion, as Freeman expresses himSelf, is visible in her aSpedl, which his wdfe assures him is wholly owing to little unaccountable flights and mean inSults, he is frequently prone to commit; tho’ he has the addreSs to con-sine them to their private hours, and she has too nice a fenSe of duty to reveal-—was this poiSon to he resisted—it run through my veins—and you have been witneSs to its effects in the first instance.
Upon this flight foundation alone, am I once more become a rambler, and in order the more effedtuallyto conceal my-Self, I intend to stain that fide of my face that was affedted by my distemper, and assume the humble bob wig in which I appeared, when Freeman was perSonally acquainted with me. TheSe articles, together
yo The Historv of
gether with the heavy langour my eyes have contradled. my sharpened features and common abfences of thought, cannot fail to give me the air of a man of cloSe Speculation, and I may bid defiance to detedtion.
I do SuppoSe my Schemes will not meet with your approbation. Domesticated by an irresistible charm, and confirmed in every worthy principle, by being out of the reach of temptation, you look upon it as the easiest thing in life, to walk Soberly and righteousiy; but believe me, my happy friend, that had you been ex-erciSed in the disappointments that have fallen to my lot, you would have found your heart beyond meaSure refradlory.
Have you not the Same degree of fire in your temper as mySelf have you not an equal share of vanity, and is not your ambition quite as unbounded—but you,
; indeed, diredt your Spirit to innocent and profitable purSuits—you are vain only in maintaining due power over your own
inclina-
Miss LE FEVER. 71
inclinations, and ambitious where the cauSe is virtue.
I feel, I acknowledge mySelf the frailest and most whimsical of beings, I can enter into all your rational, your benevolent gratifications; I esteem, nay wish, to emulate your prudence, your moderation—but there is a restlefs fomethins: which informs my breast, that is fuperior to the convidions of Senfe, and the admonitions of reafon—it will—it must be obeyed—mix pity, therefore, with condemnation ; and whilst you defpife the adion, gently cenfure the man.
You mientioned Something to me once concerning education—it has been the bane of many Such wretches as mySelf, 1 never was taught the necessity of Self-denial, nor heard the least mention of the advantages of patience and resignation. No one was fo gracious, as to prepare me to encounter mortification or difficulties, no more than if they had not had existence—yet you find I have been called
to
i
72 The Historv of
to the praftical knowledge of thoSe most trying evils; and my disqualification to Sustain them, has occafioned all the errors and iniquities I have been guilty of.
May your life continue as Serene as your condufl is justifiable; may your Soft, your endearing companion be incapable of deviating from the excellent rules she has hitherto obServed—and may nei-' ther of you ever know the miSery and wild confusion (tho’ but for a moment,) that the loSs of a beloved objedt can produce, where there is strong fufceptibility.

If 1 had never loved you, never had any other connexion with you, than during theSe last two yejars, your Sudden departure, and unwarrantable purpoSes, would grieve and alarm me; judge then what I must now feel; when, after having had you restored to me, from the very ship-wreck of honour and integrity, to know you a Second time plunged into the unfathomable deep.
My wite exceedingly laments the de--ception you have pradtiSed both upon us
VoLj Ilk	E	, and
74 TuEHisTORVor
and yourfelf; and intreats me to omit no-one argument, to Save you from yielding yourSelf a miserable stave, to the crimi* nal didlates of the most groveling of paS-fions*
Can you, my Lord, have So much of the brute about you, as to become a mere SenSualist} Where is your pride ?—What, have you no idea of the dignity the duties of a rational being?-—Your form is ered, your intelleDual faculties unimpair-*-ed: can you then deSCend to herd with the beasts of the field, tliat are incapable of the gratifications, for which you are fo immediately calculated ?
But much offended animal's, I feel, I Confest, the injustice of the conapariSon— you uniformly purSue the walk assigned ye—the voice of instinst ought to be o-beyed—you have no appetites that are unlawful, bo desires that are unjustifiable—yet when this things that calls him-^ Self your Lord, abuSes the endowments he poffeffes, and becomes reSolved to renounce
Miss LE E E V L R.
ftounce his glorious hopes of a happy immortality \ when the checks of conscience, and the stirlgs of refiedtion, are insufficient to restrain him from the groS-fest of exceffes-«r-we then proclaim him brutal, when we should stile him infer-* hal.
You fancy that love for Mrs. Leicester incites you to throw yourSelf again in her way; but you are exceedingly deceived—^ it is revenge.
You was refuSed by her; when your purpose's were what you called honour-i able, (tho’ she was even then engaged to her preSestt liushand,) from a humility^ an integrity that few females have equal-led. You cannot; yOU have not, my Lord, digested the mortifying stroke.
But how comes it, that her choice might not be as voluntary as yours ?
Your designs were of the baSest nature; on your first acquaintance with her—her Virtue wa^ too pure for your borrupt right-i=-it gave her too great Superiority E 2	over
The Historv of
over you—and her redudtion to a Suitable standard, to your own, the grand point you had in view. You Soon, howeverj discovered the folly of your attempt; Captain Le Fever’s bravery was perpetuated in his daughter’s chastity, and you Was reduced to the necessity of assuming* at least, the face of that propriety she So evidently loved.
You still failed of fucceSs—she had met with a young fellow, that poffeffed the requisite qualifications to recommend KimSelf to her approbation—and him she. accepted.
I will Spare you the recolle<5l:ion of an aftion, that repentance had almost obliterated.—She married him—^from too great Sensibility the much favoured huf-band is betrayed into error—all excesses are produdlive of mortification and un-easineSs-^and none more acute or hard to Sustain, than from exceSs of love. But Mrs. Leicester has too much discernment
to
Miss LE FEVER. 77
to mistake the cauSe, and too much candour not to excuSe and pity the effedl.
Her mother’s mild astedlion—her infant’s Smiling innocence will make her the utmost amends for the unfortunate ten-si erneSs ot her hushand—and as every being must have difficulties to cope with, perhaps none would be more light or eligible to her, than what she is called to encounter.
’ Yet you, my Lord, on another foundation, than hearing that her hufoand is not (what no mortal ever* was, and you yourSelf, you must be Sensible, are very foreign to) perfedtion; you are Setting out in order, if possible, to work that into miSery and wretchedneSs, that is at present only a trifling allay.
Forego the baSe, the cruel design, and let good a Second time reSult from evil, by leaving , the worthy Freernan, to enjoy the felicity he has derived from your Schemes.

her Sex, as well as the tranquility of my poor foul, that I should be convinced she is equal to every trial. The bare insinuation, the half formed shadow of error or impropriety in that nature, that I have So long perfuaded mySelf, is the purest that ever dwelt on earth—is beyond measure inSupportable—and I must have an opportunity of viewing her in every new light in which she may be placed. The SuSpedted wife, the mother—they afford a large field of observation and adtion, and I shall forget my own cares in my attention, my concern for hers.

I could not forbear making Mrs. Lee-Son a visit; it would have been both cruel and ungrateful to have negledted her, when within my reach. Though it will not be in my power to contribute much (as ,my stay in London will be So short,) to enliven, what age must have rendered tedious—the gloomy hours ; yet this worthy creature, just on the verge of the grave, has a thouSand refources in her-feff, that I shall never attain—true good-nefs of heart, my friend, is a Support that never fails.
Our meeting was both tender and a-greeable. The faithful Jenny, was ready to cry for joy at my return-—how many fond and tormenting ideas was revived in my breast—but as I was impatient to proceed to Brickley, I Soon took my leave, under pretence of urgent bufineSs that had called me through town, but would not permit me to continue in it,
Perhaps
Miss LE FEVER. 83
Perhaps I may be So much delighted with the joys of friendship, and the innocence of a country life in this my new expedition, as to be unwilling to renounce them. I shall affedt great reServe—my visits at the parSon’s must not be frequent, nor of long duration—but as a rich cordial, a Supporting, a reviving cordial, tasted with judgment and moderation.
The little boy—what, Leicester’s boy ? No, my Le Fever’s—had they called him Le Fever, my whole Soul should have been devoted to him—but if he has his mother’s features, can my attachment be withheld ?
I forgot to mention, that Mrs. Lee-Son, in the few moments we were together, did not fail to recommend the interest of this family to my peculiar care and consideration, and that in Such strong terms, that I reSolved to have an immediate interview with young Wed-bore, respecting the living. I found, on conversing with him, that he had a turn E 6	for
84 The Historv of
for a court chaiSe, rather than the church, and therefore introduced him to his grace, of—my particular friend, who has promised to provide for him agreeable to his wishes, and the living is to be Leicester’s for life.
I shall not, however, communicate the good news too abruptly, but examine both the hushand and wife’s condudl, before 1 Set them at the height of their wishes—if he is a barbarous wretch, and she lias anygratitude—never bounce, George, you cannot ferioufiy apprehend either the one, or the other.

Did you not perceive the necessity there was for restraining my heedleSs steps, even before we left the Abbey ? Had I not drank deep of the intoxication of beauty ?—Did I not vow an indefatigable pursuit ? And did you once exert yourSelf as you ought to have done, in diffuading me from that my declared resolution.

Mrs. Freeman to Mifs Gibson.
H O W aukward an undertaking, to inform my dear Penelope, that I am at length become the wife of honest Freeman—the murder is, however, happily out— and as we have a<5lually been married. theSe five weeks—we will let the wonder ceafe, and chat over the wedding with the fame compoSure, as if it had hap* pened uionths ago.
I had, without doubt. Sufficiently ex^ plained mySelf upon the Subjedt, to pre-.
pare
Miss LE FEVER. Sy
pare you for the otherwile astonishing ©r vent—but it is the very purpoSe, my dear, for which we all So Smartly look a-boLit us, and the final end of our creation.
My history, I hope you will allow, was very Soon wound up, by my accepting the very first man that ever Serioufly ashed me the question^but we girls of a common stamp, must not expe<5t to have it in our power to cut the flourishes your beauties can.
To be Sure, upon the whole, I am a very decentish figure—but it is not every male mortal, that might have made the discovery, and Freeman is the best-na-tured, grateful, obliging foul you ever met with.
A country apothecary, worth nine thousand pounds, I grant you is rather unuSal—^ but then he has insisted upon Securing So large a portion of it to my own uSe, that I verily think he deServes the rest—tho’
he
S8 TheHistorvof
he was even to lay it all out in fine painted gallipots.
No wife was ever more notable, than I intend to prove my Self to be, (I have in-tirely left the fine Lady at the parSon’s,) ; knitting. Spinning, and every Species of industry, shall be carried on under my roof, as an example for my more idle and leSs fortunate neighbours. Your poorer order of gentry, who with the utmost straining and difficulty, can barely make both ends meet, as the phraSe is, are a-shamed of many a£ls of ceconomy, as apprehending them to be tokens of mean-neSs, or indication of poverty—but it shall be my endeavour to render propriety fashionable—and to teach thele mis-judging females, that nothing is discommendable that is consistent with rea-fon and probity; or a refiedlion upon the head, heart or circumstances, that is wor-'thy to be performed..
It is astonishing to me, that the generality of the world should be So weak, as
to
Miss.DE FEVER. 89
to live rather in conformity to the humour of their acquaintance, than their own fortunes or inclinations. What would it be to me, if I was esteemed a degree or two leSs rich or valuable than 1 knew myfelf to be-----should I not have the happy testi-
mony of my own conScience——would not my family equally rejoice in my good management or industry, and reap the fame benefit from my example, as if my excellences and perfections were founded upon the houSe-top.
I could Say a vast deal more, quite as rnuch to the purpoSe as vrhat I have now presented you; but I SuppoSe news instead of refieClions would be your choice— you are a very foolish girl—and utterly unacquainted with your real advantage.
I have, however, a reckoning to adjust with you, Mrs. Penelope, therefore we will quit fentimenti and deScend to wrangling.
I must beg leave to make you Sensible of the folly and abfurdity of your mounting,
I
90	The History OF
ing the great horSe, Some two months ago, on my informing you, that I had no objection to fixing myfelf for life, on the Same Spot with my friend Mrs. Leicester. I thought you had understood, that that was the very purport of my visit—indeed I never once dreamt of the gentle Freeman—but might there not have been Some equally gentle Swain, to have an-Swered the intention, if he had been out of the question.
Need I tell you, that she was the acquaintance, the friend of my infancy ; and that each revolving year added treble increaSe to our tender affedlion: nay, was it not from your listening with So much patience to my conversation, when she was the Subjedt, the original recommendation to my favour and confidence. Your heart, I allow, is very prettily turned for every Soft and generous SenSation, but you must not, like Leicester, feel too strongly—I hate every i^tadow of Selfishnefs.
Apropos
Miss LE FEVER. 91
Apropos to Leicester, could you ever have conceived it possible, that he should have contracted Such shocking humours.
You know him well, modesty, polite-neSs, eaSe and ingenuouSneSs, were wont to be the only viSible adtuators of his condudt and conversation; but I perceived, the very hour I arrived, that he was greatly and alarmingly changed.
His eyes have a wildneSs and impatience, and he is to the last degree inquisitive and attentive, on the most trifling occasions—which was too plain an indication of the passion, to which Some constitutions are particularly liable, for me to be deceived ; to behold an objed with too much partiality, is a misfortune—aa ■yve are mighty apt to meaSure our neighbours feelings by our own : and conclude, that what we So abundantly dread to loSe, is Sought to be obtained by all that approach it.
But notwithstanding I have been both an eye and an e^ar-witneSs of many malicious
THEHisTORyor
cious absurdities—the Subjedl is of too tender a nature for me to start to a wife, that apparently Seeks to elude every opportunity of failing upon it—nor have I once Spoke my Sentiments, except to my good man and yourSelf. What a blessed thing it is, that he has nothing of the kind in his composition. I consider it as a distemper or lunacy of the foul, and when once attacked, for ever incurable.
Indeed, where a woman’s conduft is in any degree blameable, or when a notorious villain Seeks too many occasions to entertain her, I think it far from unnatural, that a delicate and fond hushand ' should be disturbed : but when neither the one nor the other is the cafe, and he is wholly indiscriminate in his apprehensions, I deSpiSe both him and them.
•	Mrs. Leicester, as I have frequently tojd you, is that very wife every woman ought, but few or none are capable of becoming, she lives but to oblige him ; but how she- can diSpenSe with his Infir-
•	mity,
Miss LE FEVER. 93
mity, or childishneSs of temper, I shave not the least idea; there is one article she has had the addreSs to execute, that I think is a master-piece in more reSpedls than one—her hushand has no Suspicion of her having refuSed Lord Clerage, tho’ absolutely for his own dear Sake; shew me the female, my girl, besides herSelf, that would not loudly have boasted of her constancy, her disinterestedneSs—and by over-parading the matter, have given him reaSon to SuSpedt she repented her heroiSm, But what is greater than all the rest, is, that MrSi Le Fever remains peiffedUy Satisfied with her Somin-law: nay, looks upon him as the most valuable of huS-bands. There is an amazing fubtilty in his condudt in this reSped, almost bordering upon the fubtilty of madneSs—« for I have Seen him treat her with the highest reSped, even at the very period that he has been rendering her daughter the most miserable of women—^by a thou-r Sand new invented arts of tormenting—
Such
The HiSTorv of
Such as inSuIting her for SoiHe chearfuh neSs he has obferVed in her behaviour, and to which he has himfelf incited her —Some civility she has shewn to thofe he I has called his friends-i-or Some expressions of approbation he has extorted from her for any new acquairttastce-^yet this fit once over, and never was man more tender or affeftionate—^for my part, I could as Soon sty as endure Such perplexed circumstances—ill-nature may be Supported, but theSe unreasonable transitions, from diffatisfadlion to dotage, who could comply with them.
Tho* it is, my Penelope, a wayward unsteady Sex at best : ahd perhaps Freeman, all-insinuating as he now appears, Would be tempted to exerciSe his power, if he was but as Sure of his Subjedl*
If he was to take it into his wife head, to make the experiment from conceiving, that the favoured companion of Such a woman as Mrs. Leicester, must necessarily
Miss LE FEVER. 9^
rlly follow her example, how would he find himSelf deceived*
Instead of tamely pefSistirtg in an appearance of eaSe and happineSs (as she So fuccefsftilly assumes, as almost to im* poSe upon me in Spite of the evidences of my own fenSesj I would proclaim my resentment far and near, all the town should not only know when I was in the pouts, but I would cuff the cauSe over and over in whatever company I might happen to be cast in—what pity that, with So fine a Spirit—there is So little profpedt, from the disposition of my worthy SpouSe, of my having many opportunities of displaying it.
But trifier that 1 am—to negledl "thoSe necessary preparations, for the reception of my hushand’s first friend, that I am Sensible would be a greater refie<5Hon upon my breeding and understanding, than the most Servile Submishon to the rational injundions of an honest good-natured lord and master.

I reached this town of Brickley pretty early in the evening.	^
Freeman was from home, at the par* Son’s truly—his wife and him almost live
there—happy Freeman----but beware
young
Miss LE FEVER. 97
young man—the dangerous connection, notwithstanding your union with an amiable woman, and most valuable principles, may cost you dear—Mrs. Leicester cannot be beheld with too much caution.
Freeman, the moment he heard I was arrived, hurried over to receive and congratulate me—and Leicester, from abundant civility, following cloSe at his heels, insisted on my Supping with his family.
I pleaded fatigue, dishabille—but he would have no denial. No ceremony was to Subsist between us: his fire-side knew not what it meant—and he had quitted it with a promiSe to introduce me there.
I had objections, J had palpitations, but what could I Say—there is ho resisting Some people’s perfuaSion—in a word, I Suffered rpySelf to b^ conducted to a Scene my h^art panted after, tho* it was very unfit to encounter it.
We entered the parlour.
On one side the chimney, in an eaSy chair (for I found she had been a little VoL. II.	F	indiS-

Freeman’s wife, with a lively and ingenuous aSpedt, was standing before her, increasing and participating her delight, by repeatedly calling forth the innocent raptures of the darling boy.
Leicester, with no ill grace, prelented me to his mother and our new neighbour; Madam, Said he, is, I hope, future friend —my dear, addressing Mrs. Leicester—	j
Mr. Freeman’s much valued Mr. Clayton.
I bowed upon her hand, but did not venture to Salute her.
Mrs,
Miss LE FEVER. 99
Mrs. Freeman is extremely agreeable, and Said many obliging and Sprightly things, to the viSible Satisfadlion of her hushand, and all the company.
I stole a view, at every convenient period, at a face that I once—it is over, George, and cannot be recalled — the bloom is rather faded, and the vivacity leSs striking—but I flatter mySelf, it is merely owing to the nature of the offices she is at prefent engaged in—for it is impossible to be a raScal to Such a woman.
We had a genteel, though frugal Supper ; Served up with a. propriety and decorum that Surprized me—-but site vras certainly intended for a perSon of quality—or rather was formed to adorn, what-Toever Iphere she might be cast in.

But do not conceive, that I am a jot more culpable for beholding and conversing with her—for if there is a remedy on earth for my distemper, it is ta be alone derived from that very circumstance—
I might be deceived with falSe hopes, and falSe expedtations, when at a distance— but to See her, is to be convinced, how vain and injurious every idea of Mrs. Leicester’s, that is inconsistent v/ith Mrs. l.eicester’s honour or purity.
I am an amazing favourite with the whole family at the parSon’s.
Mrs. Le Fever finds Something in my conversation and Sentiments, that is extremely agreeable to her.
Leicester, from thinking himSelf Safe in my friendship, over-whelms me wdth civilities—So unsightly a figure I own has no very dangerous or threatening an appearance—but he that judges from the outside alone will ever be liable to the grossest errors.

And the dear woman. Sir George, from being relieved, in her connexion	|
with me, from all that mortifying restraint, the peculiarity of her hushand’s temper, generally lays her under, acknowledges that she is much pleaSed with my company. She leans upon my arm, when I condud: her home of an evening from her friends—prattles to me with Such Sweet, Such enchanting familiarity, that I am afraid I Snail betray myfelf in a moment, when I least intend it, and that may prove the most unpropitious.
She has both a Son and a daughter; the little Philip is an engaging child—the other quite an infant. There would be no resssting the flattery of his being my I name-fake, if the priest himSelf could not boast the Same advantage—his tender caresses have nevertheless an unSpeakable charm for me—and when I tell you, that 1 frequently receive him from his mother’s arms—all warm, and glowing with her endearments—you cannot wonder,
that
Miss LE FEVER. 103
that Leicester’s interest in him should be forgot—and that I consider him as wholly her’s.
Mrs. Freeman has an arch and penetrating pair of eyes—it may be only conscious guilt—she often terrifies me.
As her hushand’s friend, I stand high in her esteem—but should she once fuS-pedt me of designs upon her beloved Mrs. Leicester, 1 should be instantly blown up.
I was at church yesterday-—in order to feast my sight, rather than to attend to the miserable pastor. Tho’ in all events I could not have avoided the ceremony, on the grand holiday of the week, as Mrs. Leicester calls it, without being deemed an abfolute heathen.
In London, Mrs. Le Fever took occasion to observe, nothing is So frequent as thin congregations—the inhabitants of that city, have a thouSand dissipations unknown to our nymphs and Swains—for which reaSon, continued she, they are un-F 4	able

To hear that best of women confessing her sins—made me shudder at the con-vidion of my own unworthineSs.—To find her pouring out her pious foul in thanksgiving—Suggested the recolledion of the blessings I had abuSed.—-To See that fair creature humbly intreating protedion, (that I could almost have been So prophane as to imagine, was the peculiar care of Some bright Spirit,) gave me a shocking idea of the dan- \ gers I might incur. But when she audibly

Never let it tranfpire then. Said he, for the Lady’s Sake ; Mrs. Leicester, you may depend upon it I was highly delighted.
You have an elegant taste. Sir, returned I, concealing my chagrin in the best manner I was able—nor is this the first time that I have heard her stiled the fairest of the fair.
Upon my Soul, Sir, Said he, I look upon her as the most lovely of creatures: and would give half my estate to enjoy the fame opportunities of entertaining her, that you are blessed with: but the paultry Scoundrel of a parfon keeps me at bay, conScious, I fuppoSe, that he has disqualified the lady, by his unkind treatment of her for standing a long siege.

It is my custom. Sir, Said I, astedling to laugh (though without any visible incitement) to hold the virtue of my neighbour’s wife too Sacred even for Suspicion. You apprehend yourSelf formidable with the gentleman, but is it either a just or natural inference, that you must therefore be irresistible with the lady—I con-feSs myfelf So far from Seeing the matter in the Same light you do, that I wish it was possible for me to introduce you to her acquaintance, to teach either you or myfelf a more just opinion of her than we Seem at preSent to entertain.
Sir, your humble Servant, cried he— but, however, I might be obliged to you on that occasion : your friend Leicester, would have but little to thank you for— one month, I would ash but one month to compleat the whole busineSs. Was it not a dreadful circumstance to be restrained from closing So prophane a mouth !

The rest of the conversation was as brutal as the company, and I returned home fatigued, diSgusted, and deeply wounded.
Upon my word, gallantry is a most noble proSession, since every two legged animal can conceive himSelf qualisied for SucceSs in it; nor shall I ever regret, that my impudent, my enterprizing Spirit, has forSaken me. -

I Breakfasted with Leicester this morning, and have diverted him not a little, with a description of Such part of the ’Squire’s humour, as was proper for him to be made acquainted with.
I am Surprised, Said I, in the courSe of our conversation, that you and him are not upon a good footing—he has his foibles, but is far from ill-natured, and professes himSelf well affedted towards you and your family.
He made a very lame excuSe for the ^ coolneSs he had pradliSed; and conSented to give him the meeting in a few days at Freeman’s—when the wretched rustic, will Soon discover the folly, bafeneSs, and injustice of his wiSe conjedlures.
I have now been above two months in the country, lying in wait for Some encouraging moment, to SurpriSe this longloved
Miss LE FEVER. 119
loved woman into a private friendship— never start, George—indifcretion is Several removes from criminality—you had had a clue to my designs, and might have recalled me in due time to Save us both.
But for your Satisfadlion, and my Security, I must tell you, that her behaviour is at all times So judicious, So per-fedtly conformable to the stridtest and nicest rules of decorum and delicacy, that I find it impossible to commit the {lightest breach of either the one or other, without being totally exploded.
Thus, my friend, it is most evident, that virtue can render itSelf reSpeflable and Sacred, tho’ undefended by ill-manners, or austerity, (a mistake that Some ladies are too apt to fall into,) for, when once it is apparent from the whole tenor of a woman^s condudl:, that her foul is pure, who can approach her without reverence.
Her chearfulneSs is the best indication of her mind’s health, her language the

emblem of her elegant conceptions, and her piety the strongest testimony of her divine origin-—the beauty, the lovelinefs of her perSon, may for a moment inSpire Such wishes, as incited me to visit Brick-iey-^but they must receive an infallible check, or at least be reduced to tender regard, by the genuine difplay of still Superior perfedions.
I have Some distant hopes of rendering this bold wretch Serviceable to my own purpoSes. He shall have an opportunity of exercising his odious, clumfey arts, to allure her to his views—and I, as by accident, will betray my knowledge of his proceedings—she will be terrified at the effed they would have upon her hushand’s mind, if revealed to him—and I would not only adviSe her to preServe them Secret, but offer my best affistance—she— but you must have an idea by this time, of the natural progression of a growing intimacy---and may without any far-
ther

ther light, trace it out to its final termination.
It is very true. Sir George, your friend Clerage was an unSucceSsful fellow in most of his undertakings—the impetuosity, the impatience of his diSpoSition ever defeating his own purpoSes.
But Clayton, with all that fire Clerage is possessed of, has a happy SedateneSs, a deep penetration, a quick apprehension, and an animated invention—you shall only hear what a pretty cats-paw he has made of his rustic acquaintance.
Leicester, his wife and mother, no Sooner Saw the ’Squire’s coach stop at Freeman’s, than they hurried over, lest they should make them wait dinner.
Freeman introduced them to the overbearing wretch—which piece of strained civility, hurt poor Clayton not a little— Mrs. Leicester’s lips were never formed for Such barbarous Salutations.
The pastor was obliged to attend a funeral in the afternoon—it was a lucky

incident—nor did the ’Squire fail to avail himSelf of it—and by pouring forth a volley of stupid compliments, and behaving with the most aukward particularity. Occasioned many Significant and discouraging changes, in the lady’s intelligent and lovely Seatures.
Leicester, at length returning, the ’Squire •became very tractable—but whiSpered me on his departure, (with an air of the highest exultation,) that the game was now happily started, and he had nothing to do, but to run it down.
One meeting in the country, as naturally begets another, as—but 1 will give you the simile, when 1 do not abound with fubjedl matter.
We were all invited to the ’Squire’s, Mrs. Leicester laboured hard to be ex-cuSed going ; but her hushand (Supported by my perSuasions,) for that very reafon, exerted his utmost authority, and she was too dutiful to persist in her refuSal.

You must have too much discernment, Sir, returned she, to mistake the cauSe. Mr. Stilton’s charadter is a most profih gate one; his manners and conversation, very far from unexceptiona Me. I do not mean to insinuate, that he has any other designs upon me, than he would entertain against any other female. But a married woman ought to be, beyond measure, nice in her connexions. Had I been a man, I had been a Cmsiir, with re-Spedt to my wife;—nor would it have been Sufficient with me, that she was really virtuous, but she must have been thought So; and vrho can anSwer for the conSe-quence of giving into an improper acquaintance—his rude breath.

Mrs. Freeman, by her agreeable vivacity, preSc.'ved the harmony and good understanding of the whole party—-and tve returned well Satisfied, and well pleaS-ed, both with ourSelves and each other.
Hitherto, my George, I have not taken one step to offend even your rigid virtue— Mrs. Leicester has more than ever recommended herSelf to my fondest approbation—I must admire, I must doat upon her—but will find my conSolation in knowing mySelf her f. iend, and friend of my faithful Hendon.

Easter, WhitSuntlde, and Christmas, are the most convestient, as well as happiest periods in the whole rural round of life.
Stilton, from a fond and preposterous perSuaSion, that his frequently repeated aukwardneSs and assiduity had obtained him Some degree oS unwarrantable inte-rell, in the chastest of human hearts, gave us all an invitation to his houSe, to celebrate the WhitSun-feast.
Great preparations, we were informed by-the-by, had been for Some time carried on, in order to render the Icene at once, marvellous and delightful, and as we were Sensible his gardens, in Lord Chalk-stone’s language, had very -pretty capar hilities^ our expedations were raiSed to a very decent pitch.

Never did my lovely woman appear to greater advantage, than .upon this occasion, by Mrs. Freeman’s management and assistance—who insisted upon it, that her fair friend should for once convince Mr. Clayton, that she did not over-rate her perSonal perfedlions, in her description of them, when unobScured by her matronly arts.
Her-hair was diSpoSed with the utmost grace, by the judicious hand of this af-fedionare Lady—her gown, by the Same e!e£lion and authority, was a pale pink Sattin; her petticoat and shoes white, ditto, and her linen Such as she had wore in her day of elegance.
How, did this agreeable and generous Mrs. Freeman then exult in the charms she had drawn forth, utterly inSensible to the beautiful negligence, pleasing vivacity, and lovely benevolence. So apparent in herSelf.
The parSonage-houSe was in our way to the hall. Freeman and I were to join
company
Miss LE FEVER. 127
with the priest and the ladies there.
Leicester offered his arm to Mrs. Le FevTr, whoSe eyes Sparkled with maternal complacence; and communicated an increaSe of Satisfadbion to every heart. To your care, Mr. Clayton, Said the deluded hushand, 1 commit my wife—Freeman will eScort his—-and thus we shall be all comfortably paired.
How unaccountable is prejudice ! How erroneous credulity ! Freeman, tho’ married to the objedb oS his choice—tho’ his principles are pure, his condudl; irreproachable, and his constitution free from every vice, is more formidable in Lei- * cester’s sight, than an imposture—a sty insinuating villain—and the deepest of designers. But here lies the stumbling-block of his wife judgment—Freeman’s perSon is pleasing, and his disposition lively—whereas, famine and mortification Seem to have marked the miserable Clayton for their own.

We were ushered immediately on our arrival at the "Squire’s—into the gardens. A variety of objedls Seized our eyes.
Alcoves, CliineSe temples, falls of water, shady retreats, wide extended lawns, and flowery borders, proclaimed at once the taste and expence of their wrong-headed owner.
On the largest canal, in humble immi-tation of what you meet with at Rane-lagh, was a kind of pavilion, furnished with a band of the best musicians that could be procured on a very short notice, (for this Sublime stroke was not reSolved upon, until the very preceding day to sis execution,) who Scraped here and there a bit of Alexander’s feast, to the inexpressible delight and entertainment of Several of the principal farmers, their wives and children, in the whole neighbourhood.
Dinner was ferved up in a Spacious alcove ; and liberal libations offered to the goddesses of health and festivity.
Hilton
Miss LE FEVER. 129
Hilton Seldom or ever quitted Mrs. Leicester’s side, his admiration, his Sensibility of the improvement in her appearance, could not be concealed.
Her hushand Seemed determined to riSe Superior to himSelf for that day at leaSt; and having repeated to me in a Sort of careleSs jocoSe manner, as he passed us Soon after dinner, that to my care he committed his wife, and at my hands he should require her, at the concluSion of the evening, left her entirely free from all interruption, 1 could not but obferve, however, that he frequently turned his head towards us—when perceiving I was true to my trust, he appeared content. I fay appeared, George, for his heart could not be perfectly unagitated, from the nature of his tendernefs, and the invaluableneSs of the objedt—for was it not Mrs. Leicester ?
Some of the tenants daughters, in the habits of shepherds and shepherdesses, presented us with Several rustic dances— and about ten o’clock at night an ill-con-G 5	studied
130 T H E H I S T O R y O F
diKsted fire-works was played off, which , was to be Succeeded by a ball, in a large room illuminated for the purpoSe.
After this last piece of folly had been exhibited, we v/ere directed to return to the houSe. Gur numbers were greatly increased, and Some little diSorder aroSe in the procession, from Several of the gentlemen’s being much elevated.
I would have perSuaded Mrs. Leicester to accept of my arm for her protection, but she politely declined it—and in the next instant, I had the mortification to find, she had been hurried away by the croud quite out of my sight.
It immediately occurred to me, that fome villainous artifice had been practiced—and I begun to accuSe mySelf as the indiredl caufe of whatever misfortune might be the conSequence. I was; too well acquainted with her hushand’s disposition, however, to venture to communicate my apprehensions, except at the last extremity : I therefore, breaking thro’
the .
Miss LE FEVER. igi
the croud, reSolved to-Seize the first Servant I met, and compel him to diScover his master’s diabolical Schemes.
1 had Scarce reached the end of a short walk, before I perceived a fellow I Soon recognized, parading before a little fiat Summer-houSe, that was almost buried in roSe-bushes and lillies, as a Spy or guard. I collared him without farther ceremony, Mrs. Leicester cried, I (half-choaked with rage and apprehenSion) where has Mrs. Leicester been conveyed to^—the guilt, the Self-importance of your aSpecft convinces me, that you are the prime a-gent in the. baSe tranSadlion,
He pointed to the fummer-houSe—my horror was inexpressible—I dragged him to the entrance, and obliged him to add. his strength to mine to force the well-Sc-cured door.
The moment the Sweet creature beheld me, file flew to me for protedHon.
I have been groSsly ifiSulted, cried she— but let me leave the hateful Spot, and if G 6	possibly
132 I^heHistorvof
possible forget the unprecedented breach of honour and hoSpitality.
The villain, all diScompoSed in his dreSs, .and Sinking with cowardly confusion, would have made the most abjeft concessions—but she hid her lovely face with her hands—and only repeated, let me leave the place, and if you have So much humanity, as not to aggravate the injury,' I will promise you shall never have an opportunity of repeating it—my hushand’s peace, next to preServing my perSon from violation, is my dearest consideration— blit my good Mr. Clayton, added she, do not delay the accomplishment of the blessed work you have began—remove me from this Scene—and by silence and Secrecy,' reSpefting the unhappy circumstances from' which you have delivered me, Secure me from every otherwiSe consequential evil.
1 will wait upon you in the morning. Sir, Said I, with a menacing air, to the despicable culprit—the lady’s peace must *	■	be
^ Miss LE FEVER. 13^
be our first, our only care. Trembling and terrified, 1 then conveyed her almost in my arms into the houSe.
SuppoSe you complain of illneSs, Madam, Said I, I fear the complaint will but be too just —but it is necessary you should remain Some time in MiSs Stillton’s apartment, to recover yourfelf, and a reaSon must be affigned to the company for the not joining them—I will Send your friend, Mrs. Freeman, to revive and chear you.
I have obligations, Sir, returned she— what indeed do I not owe you—but I apprehend I shall never have the courage to do you the justice to reveal them to any one—if my poor hushand was ever to hear—
Let it never be mentioned. Madam, —this moment, this blessed moment, cried I (pressing her clofer in order to render mySelf more uSeful) shall consign the whole remembrance to oblivion. I have only assisted you in the Same degree I
would

I condufted her to a parlour—Sent for MiSs Hilton, and Mrs. Freeman—bow- ; ed and retired.
The ’Squire having redlified the diS* orders in his appearance, ventured to enter the ball-room. He had not the'Von-fidence, however, once to encounter my eyes. His expressions, when he was compelled to Speak, were wild and incoherent, and his behaviour abSurd and inconsistent : but as he had been obServed to drink very freely, no one was SurpriSed either by the one or the other.
Leicester was not affedled by the information of his wife’s in disposition, as I had apprehended he would—he only Smiled, and Said, he hoped she would Soon be better. I could not refrain from commenting upon his coolneSs to Free^ man, who Soon gave me to understand, that it proceeded from his knowledge of
the
a
Miss LE FEVER. 135
the circumstances she was then under, which Subjedled her to frequent, tho’ not dangerous, interruptions of health.
This intimation had nevertheless a very different effedl upon me, to which it was intended to produce—should the conSe-quence be fatal to her life—heaven, kind heaven, for once be propitious to a sinner’s prayer, and Spare this ornament of her Sex (as you Hendon emphatically stiled her, in an epistle that was far from being duly honoured) a little longer, to enliven and instrudt this lower world.
We had the brute’s coach to convey us home ; and I pasted a steepleSs night, from revolving the Scenes I had been engaged in.
Early next morning, according to appointment, I waited upon this black clumSey Scheemer (you See, George, your miserable friend is not the only existing villain) and threw his little unworthy foul into fearful trepidations.
I
The Historv of
' l acknowledge. Said he, Mr. Clayton, with shame and remorSe I acknowledge my error; Mrs. Leicester’s virtue is invincible ; she is the fairest and the proudest woman I ever met with.
Wretch, cried I, and is that the best, the nicest distinflion, you are capable of making, between chastity, and its opposite extreme. You, that was So confident of SucceSs—that had started your game—but you shall be given up to the just reSentment of an injured and most tenacious hushand.
For Mrs Leicester's Sake, returned he, for Mrs. Leicester’s Sake, Sir, I beSeech you to forego this deSperate reSolution— you cannot make me Suffer alone. Consider her preSent condition, remember the delicacy of her mind and body.
I could have shook him to atoms.
Thou cloven-footed preacher, exclaimed I—^and can the mention of mercy fall from Such unmerciful lips—Wherein did you conSider her } Wherein did you Sparc
her ?
Miss LE FEVER. 137
her ? But you are So abjedl a mortal, that to parley with you, is to give you too much conSequence. I have, however, thought of a means of revenging this most atrocious attempt, without involving the amiable Mrs Leicester, in the Smallest inconvenience. You shall this very day enter into a bond for your good behaviour for Seven years to come. No hunting—no one Scene of revelling or debauchery, shall you engage in during that whole period; the church is greatly out of repair; your hunters shall be diS-poSedof; your hounds turned a-driSt; and your huntSman discharged; and the profits arising from the Sale of the former, and the reduced expences of the latter, shall be equally appropriated to that uSe. You shall likewise bestow a new gown and coat, and an annual dinner upon every poor parishioner, to celebrate your happy eScape from at best a just proSecution ; and above all the rest, you shall ered a temple, in the most conspicuous part of the village,
to
138 The HiSTORy of
to that pure goddefs you have So egrc-gioussy dared to prophane; and as you have given a proof of a pretty romantic turn in the improvements of your gardens, and your entertainments of the tenants—^you shall next year, instead of fireworks, institute little games for the younger part of the neighbourhood; with Songs and devices, in honour and promotion of that most lovely of virtue’s fair-eyed chastity ; and, finally, you shall remove yourSelf from Brickley (having given proper directions for all that I have mentioned) until the grand anniverSary, when you shall return to weave and present the first garland to the atoning shrine.
What think you now, George, have I not a very tolerable idea of poetical justice.
Brutality is ever in conjunction with cowardice—he gladly complied with the prescribed terms, to clear himSelf from Leicester’s wrath: and 1 shall by this method render him a future blessing, to
the
Miss L E F E V E R. i 59
the country, where he has hitherto been an absolute pest.
I had the pleaSure to find, on calling in at Leicester’s, that my charming woman was much better than could have been expedled ; and that her hushand and friends, were free from every SuSpicion of the true caufe of her diSorder.
I told them of the ’Squire’s intended decampment; and could perceive, that Mrs. Leicester had both Sufficient generosity and understanding, to place it to the proper account—she thanked me with her eyes—I will fallow her Sweet example with the nicest punDuality—nor un-leSs she herSelf tells the tale before me, ever Suffer one Syllable of it to tranSpire— her hushand’s temper So Singular, can she be too -cautious.
I find by Mrs. Freeman, that the uncertainty reSpedting the living, sits heavy at that heart whoSe peace is So peculiarly dear to me-—but it shall be relieved from its anxiety in a post or two—

I could almost become Superstitious upon the occasion ; and tremble for my own fate. But am I not punished far beyond whatever fetters or confinement could prove ?—Do I not behold the only woman I ever did or ever can love, in the possession of another?—Do I not daily discover Some new and enchanting per-* fedtion in her Soul, to aggravate my mi-Sery ? And have I the least proSpedt of its being mitigated ? I may be calm,

How blessed should I now have been— Leicester would then have made, his visit too late—but take notice, my friend, she never will be mine, (or Providence must deviate from every general rule,) we See many men obtain their wishes, to convince them of their vanity and empti-neSs—many proSper in the way of vice, to augment their curSe—but to obtain Mrs. Leicester, would be to obtain the greatest of rewards, and how little pretensions

I can, I do perceive, that she esteems me—does a woman esteem her gallant, George?—Esteem and villainy, must be

I grant you, it is a horrible thing to betray the young and unwary—there can be no triumph, as I have frequently told you, where there is no vicflory—and the simple, uninformed heart, is ill qualified for the resistance, that can alone gratify the proud and Spirited lover. But with a woman of understanding, education, and experience, the cafe is quite otherwise—it is preference, it is choice, it is the most flattering of distinftions. What fay you, to be a partaker with the aduU trefs, the instrument of her withered revenge, and the cauSe of entailing diSgrace upon her tender, helpleSs offspring?— You are perpetually starting abSurdities, Sir George—who is obliged to look So far into confequences and contingences— the Lady likes me, I like the Lady—she

. But, for once I have alarmed you without a caufe; no vestal was ever held more Sacred by the most Superstitious heathen, than Mrs. Leicester’s chastity by me—I am convinced it is invincible, and nothing is So foreign to my heart, as an intention to. attack it. I will tell you Hendon, when a woman is curSed with Such a hushand as Leicester; yet retain her chearfulneSs, or makes him the Subjedt of either her ridicule or contempt—there is Sufficient encouragement—but when every instance of unkindneSs apparently sinks deep, and the lovely Sufferer Seeks no other conSolation, than what piety and resignation can give, she is, as it were, defended by ten thouSand shields, and we consider her as invulnerable.
I am at preSent So near happineSs, that ifit wasnot for the evidences of Mrs.

What erroneous, what unworthy impressions do we receive oS the women, by being acquainted with only the light, inconsiderate part of the Sex. To ridicule, to stigmatize, to miS-repreSent them, has been the common-place wit of every petty author, and the practice of every age.
But who can behold Mrs. Leicester, or Mrs. Freeman, and not venerate them— the pradlical virtues of the one, and the heart-felt ones of the other—are almost equally amiable—and have at least been instrumental to making one honest fellow happy.
Freeman and his fair companion are most excellently lusted. He has the generosity, the capacity, to distinguish and approve, thoSe perfedlions his wife has ' the judgment, the dexterity to diSplay.

To tell you how comfortably we have enjoyed ourSelves during Leicester’s absence," is impossible—content has reigned in every heart—and friendship glowed in every countenance. What are the pleasures, the purSuits of vice, to Such a period—it was indeed too blessed to be of long continuance. Mrs. Leicester received a letter this morning from our common disturber, acquainting her, that she Vvi'ill See him in the evening, if he is able to perform the journey—for that he has been Seized with a fever, and finds himSelf very indifferent.

He loves to alarm, George, and I have neither hopes nor fears upon the occaSioru Mrs. Freeman looks arch—he is mortal, Said she, when her friend was gone— tho’ over-bearing and tyrannical.
I shall wait his arrival, with the patience of a philosopher, and let whatever be the event, will ad; agreeable to the cha-rafter you wish me to preServe.
But, O! my friend, how shall I con-feSs to you, that all the mifery this most valuable of women has endured, with re-fped; to her hushand’s temper, has all been derived from me. The poor wretched, injured Leicester—Freeman has discovered, that he is adually flighty at times, I have employed a perSon to examine into his family—and am assured, no tincture of it can^ be found—his brain was certainly shook by the distresses I heaped upon him—Save me, Hendon, O !

She was in her parlor, George, her eyes betrayed the too generous, and strong Sensibility of her heart.
I beg your pardon. Sir, Said she, rising on my entrance—but 1 am encouraged

Sir, kindly perSuade her to s:o to Mrs. Freeman’s houSe, until we know the fate of the unhappy Sufferer— and exert your humanity to preServe this most valuable part of me.
I was strangely let down by the tenor of this request—for to render mySelf in any degree Serviceable to Mrs. Le Fever,
'	was obliging mySelf rather than her—and
1 had flattered mySelf, quite the reverfe would have been required of me.
You could not have aSked any thing , more agreeable to my inclination. Madam, returned I, than to Support Mrs. Le Fever—wshere shall I find her, to engage her to favour me with her company—but who will take care of you, and lessen your fatigue.

I found it no eaSy talk to prevail upon her to quit her child at So trying a period—but having remonstrated to her, that site had other children to demand her care—it was at last fettled, that they and their nurSe should accompany her to our habitation, She had, it Seems, withstood the perSuaSion of every other perSon, but my arguments were enforced with the complacence of a stranger, and the weight bf disinterestedness—which was what Mrs. Leicester depended upon in her application to me. This point got over, Ire-turned once more to Mrs. Leicester’s, in-order to Speak with Mrs. Freeman.
Consider, my dear Madam, Said I, the alarming circumstances your friend is un-H 5	der

I shall do every thing in my power. Sir, replied the lady, but Mrs. Leicester upon theSe occasions changes her very nature. She is no longer the gentle, persuadable creature, you and I have ever known her—but obstinate and immoveable—nor could you prevent her attendance upon her hushand, if even her own life was in danger.
I know your affedlion for her, cried I, is equal to my own—yet I cannot help conjuring you, (but recolledling how im-befiting my warmth,) I am certain, added I, in a much lower key, you will be very careful of her—for she is a most amiable woman.
She beheld me with visible SurpriSe, (we cannot be always upon our guard,) especially on theSe trying occasions, when all one’s happineSs is at stake.

He is dead, George—it was a folly to trouble you with vain repetitions
of apprehensions and disturbances'--he
departed this very morning.
Mrs. Leicester never quitted his bed* side, until he had breathed his last—but bears the shock and fatigue with amazing fortitude.
I wrote an account of his illneSs to Mrs. LeeSon, who immediately Sent dov:n a preSent of fifty pounds, to defray extra expences, in cast of the contingence that threatened, and has now taken place;
id 6	with

with the warmest assurances of friendship, in cafe Mrs. Leicester should become a ^ widow.
Her cloSe confinement, and watching, have altered her prodigiousiy.
I would have perfuaded her to leave “ the houSe—but she fays, death has no terrors for her, nor will she sty from it.
She Supported every turn of the unhappy Sufferer’s temper without complaint, even to the cruel reproaches, that she would rejoice in her Survival, and Soon bestow herfelf upon another.
Nor shall the prophecy be unfulfilled.
I have already applied to Lady Catharine, as from my proper Self by letter, wherein I have informed her of Leicester’s death, and my unextinguished af-fedlion for his charming widow—I have likewise intreated her ladyship to consider, that it is impossible for me to offer, or her to accept, of any assistance of mine, under her preSent circumstances — but I have affured her, that the moment
decency
Miss LE FEVER. 157
decency will permit, I mean, to pro-poSe mySelf -upon the fame terms, she (Lady Catharine) once So much approved : I therefore must hope, I add, that she will not let her be reduced to the necessity (which must certainly otherwife be the cafe) of Soliciting charity from any other quarter, by taking her under her prote(5lion—particularly as an expensive time is approaching, and she has even now two children that must be provided for.
Her anSwer cannot but be propitious; tho’ she deSpiSed and ridiculed me for re-linguishing my pretensions in favour of the deceaSed, and abhorred his very name —all animosity, all diSesteem, ought now to terminate—Soft rest his dust, for he was my Le Fever’s hushand ; be all his faults forgotten, for he was the father of her lovely children.—No, no, George, it is only cowards that purSue beyond the grave—I am not one of thoSe curs, that

I can Scarce forbear trusting the worthy hearted Mrs. Freeman with all my Schemes. But the Surest method not to be cenSured, is, to preServe unrevealed what might ia-cur it: I will therefore persist in my Secrecy, until it can no longer avail me— and will then break out in my own long negledted brightneSs, to captivate the fair Andromacha—she, in the anguish of her foul, weeps over her tender infants—but the good time will come, when weeping shall be no more—and she shall receive incontestible proofs of my repentance ■ and love.

Letter XXVI.
Mrs, Freeman to Mifs Gibson.
POOR Leicester—well—all is at an end with him, as I told you, in a few words, by the last post, and his wife
once
Miss LE FEVER. 159
once more at liberty to make her fortune.
Lord Clerage may have his faults, Penelope ; but he has diSplayed Such good-neSs of heart. Such delicacy towards our friend, that they ought never more to be remembered. Some perSon it Seems, in the neighbourhood, informed him of Mrs, Leicester’s circumstances.
He instantly applied to that unfeeling Lady Catharine, in her favour; and has obtained a hundred pounds a year for her, by way of annuity. So long as she remains a v/idow.
Had he offered his whole estate to have Saved her from the last extremity, she would not have accepted a single shilling —but from the hands of Lady Catharine it cannot be refuSed ; and with the addition of her mother’s pittance, and Mrs. LeeSon’s friendly compliments, she may now provide for herSelf and family very comfortably in the country.
But.
16o	The H i s t o r y o r
But to shew you the shocking nature of that woman of quality, reproaches would intermix with benevolence. She broadly insinuates, what she might have been— and concludes with hoping, that she has Smarted too Sensibly for her folly ever to repeat it—that Such men as Lord Clerage, are not every day to be met with, and in general when once repulSed, their friendship is utterly lost—but that he had worked So strongly upon her tenderneSs (Lady Catharine know any thing of tenderneSs, my dear) by his renewed eloquence, as to make her recoiled: all the Soothings the Soft perSuasion Kitty Le Fever was once mistreSs of—and in Spite of all her resolutions to the contrary, induced her So far to consider her, as to Save her from starving. She has a fine fortune—and for the poor children’s fake, must be tolerated in her inSolence—elSe who could endure it.
I SuppoSe we shall hear more of his Lordship in due time; and if he had my
voice
Miss LE FEVER. i6i
voice before, which you are Sensible he really had, it will now be doubled and redoubled in his interest:.
Mrs. Leicester is certainly a most charming woman; but 1 would nob wish, my Lord, to behold her at preSent—she is not the Same creature, except in disposition, where she will ever remain unchanged.
Nothing upon earth could have So ef-fedlually relieved her as this annuity ; I could idolize the first Suggestor of it; the parSonage-houSe must be quitted as Soon
as possible----they are to live with us,
at least for a year or So—and we shall all be one family, as we have long been one heart.
I strongly fuSpedt there is a perSon, however, that must yet be unhappy, if my conjedtures, reSpedting Lord Clerage’s intentions, are just—and that is the valuable Clayton. I am convinced he loves her, better perhaps than he himSelf may
have
iSl T H E FI I S T 0 R y O F
have been aware of; and would Soon be perking up his ears to Solicit a return.
Well, Surely Freeman and mySelf are patterns of conjugal felicity : nor can I wonder at Mr. Clayton’s wishing to follow So happy an example. I do not remember that he has ever once attempted to oppoSe my inclination, or contradict my will—I may, therefore, with great propriety declare, I have never diSobey-ed him. I Sometimes examine my glaSs, and now and then look into my mind, to discover, if possible, the charm that So afconishingly faScinates him—it lies nor, my friend, within my depth, I do affure you. I am neither old, ugly, nor an absolute driveller—but certainly never merited the happy fate that has awaited me; nor could there be the least probability of my fixing So excellent a heart. I dare believe (nay he has told me So himSelf, as Sir Harry Seycamore Says) that he (poor Soul) thinks me in every degree equal to the incomparable Mrs.' Leicester.
There
Miss LE FEVER. 163
‘ There is no accounting for it—but the very extraordinary people of each Sex, are in general the most unfortunate; had Mrs. Leicester’s merit been of a common size, she had perhaps avoided all the mi-Sery she has experienced—but then she would never have been Lady Clerage—« there I am most effeclually silenced—fot* to be a Lady, who would not endure a long Succession of grievances.

IA M So astonished, my Penelope— that I know' not when I shall recover mySelf; this worthy Mr. Clayton, my hushand’s great benefadlor, the friend of every heart, and the extraordinary favourite
164 TheHistorvof
rite of the poor deceived Leicester’s, is no other than that very Lord Clerage you have So frequently heard me mention : the manner I discovered it was this.
Mrs. Leicester is So indiSpoSed, that she Seldom quits her chamber, though little more than the common conSequence of her preSent condition. Mrs. Le Fever naturally Spends her whole time with her child, and we only visit them occasionally. Freeman is obliged to be abSent many hours in the'day with his patients— and Mr. Clayton, as he was called, generally amuSed himSelf with reading or writing, when he could not have our com- • pany, I have often wondered at the peculiarity of his humour.
I had been up stairs with Mrs. Leicester ; and finding her Spirits would not bear much conversation, I told Mr. Clayton, that if he pleaSed, we would drink our ■■	tea that afternoon in my parlour.
He looked alarmed—is Mrs. Leicester worSe, Madam, demanded he ^
’ No,
Miss LE FEVER. 165
No, Sir, not as to her health I believe ; but she Seems very low, and I fear our chat would be too much for her.
Just as you pleaSe, Madam, returned he (though with visible reludtance) and the tea was brought in.
Now, thought I, as the opportunity is So fair, I will feel his pulSe a little, for I had too much regard for him, not to be grieved at any proSpedt of afflidtion to his heart.
What an alteration. Said I, does a few years produce in Some people—poor Mrs. Leicester—-who, that knew MiSs Le Fever, would conceive it possible.
Who indeed, returned he, hastily, yet is she still lovely—but recolledling him-Self, he in Some degree moderated the warmth of his accent, and added, I heard she was a very fine young lady.
I looked at him, and could perceive, his countenance was much confuSed—imputing it, however, to a wrong cauSe, I passed it over. She was indeed, Sir,
Said
i66 The Historv of
Said I, the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ; no wonder Lord Clerage was So captivated—he sighed, I fancy the im-preshon is not yet totally obliterated.
Obliterated, cried he, a Second time, forgetting himSelf, impossible—I fancy Mrs. Freeman (again restraining his feelings) the man that once loved Mrs. Leicester could not easily Subdue his paffion for her.
I have a great notion. Said I, his lord-ship will renew his application. So Soon as circumstances will permit—and I greatly hope she will be prevailed upon to accept of him.
Ten thouSand bleSs—exclaimed he, but checking himSelf, he did not finish the ' Sentence; it will be very good of you, Madam, refumed he, after a pauSe, to interest yourSelf in his behalf, as his constancy andperSeverance evince the strength of his affedlion.
I believe he deServes her. Said I, (still So stupid as to be in the dark, with reSpe<5t
to
Miss LE FEVER. 167
to the real occasion of his odd behaviour,) but you will excuSe me. Sir, iS I tell you that I have obServed Some things in you, that beSpeak the tenderest consideration for her; and I would not promote an union that might wound your peace.
My peace. Madam, (not apprehending me,) my peace, my happineSs, replied he, all depend upon my SucceSs ; she must not, she shall not, refuSe my renewed—
How, Sir, cried I, you deal in contra-didtions Surely—yet your language, your countenance, are too intelligent for me to be deceived—is it possible, that under this diSguiSe 1 behold Lord Clerage.
Speak low I beSeech you. Madam—you have detected me—you have furprifed me into a discovery, I but yesterday reSolved against^—1 am, indeed, that unhappy Cler-age—you know all my iniquities, my Sufferings—but to pity the miserable is your every day’s pradice—tho’ as little deServ-
ing
i68 The Historv of
ing of your kindneSs as the wretch now before you.
I again repeat, cried I, it is imposh-ble—to what end can you have proceeded in the manner you have done ; heaping favours upon a family, without their even SuSpe6ling their benefadtor was So near— I can recall innumerable instances to my remembrance oSyour humanity, your delicacy and generosity, nor shall I ever fail to honour the merits of So noble a disposition.
Hold, Mrs. Freeman, Said he, you are groSsly deceived in your opinion of me. It is true, I have adled agreeable to all you mention, but since you have found me out in one reSpedl, I will not " conceal mySelf in another. I came down to this place for the most unworthy, the baSest of purpoSes—but Mrs. Leicester’s good-neSs and virtue awed me into repentance, and totally Subdued the infernal principles by which I was adtuated. I always held it for a rule, that when a man became
iealous
Miss LE FEVER. 169
jealous without a cauSe, a woman reSolved to justiSy his luSpicions—and I hoped to have recommended mySelf to that kind-neSs I conceived the hushand had forfeited—and by degrees have reduced your all amiable friend, to the mean level of the worst of her Sex. You, my good Madam, have nevertheless been an eye-wit ♦ neSs of my conduct, formed even upon So detestable a plan. The bar to every honourable expedtation is now removed ; and if you can perSuade yoiirSelf, that I am capable of making Mrs. Leicester happy, employ your voice in my favour, otherwise I will forego my purSuit, and never once interrupt her.
What a daring, and at the Same time, what a great Soul this man must poffeSs.
I affured him of my vote and utmost interest, begged him not to quit our family—and impatiently wished for my huS-> band’s return.
I am concerned. Said he, to think how Freeman will be shocked at the diScove-
VoL. II.	I	ry
lyo The Historv of
ry—to loSe his friend, and find an impostor in his houSe—but I fuppoSe it cannot be avoided.
Indeed, my Lord, replied I, I will not profeSs mySelf one of thoSe wives, that can conceal much from their hushand’s; e-fpecially from Such a hushand as I am bleS-Sed with—you can have nothing to fear from him—he knows human nature. Sir, and, however vain the observation, is no stranger to the power of love—and the extraordinary goodneSs and benevolence you have So long praftiSed, ought per-fedlly to eraSe every unpleafing remembrance.
Freeman returned, tho’ much fatigued with riding, with his uSual good humour. I broke the matter to him, in the most prepared manner I was capable of—but I could perceive the loSs of his friend, (as his Lordship foretold,) Sunk very deep.
Lord Clerage was all condescension, Self-accuSation and penitence—and who would not have forgiven Such an offender.
It
Miss LE FEVER. 171
It was now agreed, that he should mention an intention to leave Brickley—and withdraw himSelf without the knowledge of any one; and that Mrs. Leicester should never be made acquainted with the particulars of his conduD, until she had been Some time Lady Clerage.
His Lordship is either to build or pur-chafe a houSe in our neighbourhood, and we shall all live, I hope, to bleSs the fertility and whimsicalneSs of his invention.
I received a message from Mrs. Leicester during our conversation, requesting my company; which 1 instantly complied with, and endeavoured to compoSe my features into their uSual gravity.
But the thoughts of Lord and Lady Clerage, communicated Such an irresistible degree of risibility to my whole aSped, that my friends cliallenged me for the good news the moment they beheld me, which I had bound mySelf to keep Secret. I contrived, however, to amuSe and trifle ' with them So dexteroussy, that they at 1 2	length
172 The History of
length lost their Scent, and I came off triumphant.
Be comforted, my girl, you shall not loSe a hushand by the bargain—Clayton was a Serious Soul—we will find you Something hereafter, that shall better Suit your taste.
I am, &c.

Clerage to iSzV George FIendon.
NOW, my friendly George, am I once Tnore become a candidate for happipefs in my own proper perSon.
Th^ peace, the Satisfadtion I have lo long enjoyed, in the friendship and approbation of theSe worthy people at Brick-ley, is put upon the hazard, in' order to recommend mySelf in a charadler of still
greater
Miss LE FEVER. 175
greater importance—in a word. Freeman and his wife know me for that wretched thing Clerage.
But I have as yet no great cauSe for complaint; Mrs. Leicester lives, and is at liberty—and must yield herSelf to the united importunities of thoSe perSons that condeScend to eSpouSe my interest.
She has, its true, one alarming extremity to paSs through; but why should it be more fiital at this, than other preceding periods—only to render me more completely undone.
Mrs. Freeman has kindly touched upon Clerage’s merits, to the mother and daughter; intimating, that she heard it was his intention to offer himSelf a Second time.
Mrs. Leicester appeared SurpriSed, but not disagreeably ; his Lordship, Said she, must have too much delicacy, not to be Sensible of the impropriety of visiting me for Some months at least; for could I So Soon forget what is due to the memory I 3	of
- /
J74 The Historv of
of a hushand, it is impossible I should become unmindful of my duty to my chil-< dren—nay children yet unborn.
This restridtion is unanswerable, and I will pay all proper honour to it. My cauSe shall be Submited to the intire management of Freeman and his wife; they are friends to each party, and will do them justice.
My bob-wig shall be hung up as a trophy of my vidtory ; for I could by no other means on earth have been Successful ; and 1 shall ever rejoice in the recol-ledlion of my Sober charadler.
I will tell you what I propoSe. I will apply to Lady Catharine for the Seven thouSand pounds she once offered me, and make Lady Clerage a Settlement Suitable to her merit and my love; then immediately, by deed of gift, divide her fortune equally amongst the little children; for they must not be expoSed, George, to the precarious dependance on capricious wills.
Yet
Miss LE FEVER. 175
Yet fair and flattering as my prefent proSpedts are, I cannot be the gay fellow you once knew me; nor even the actual obtaining Mrs. Leicester’s hand can render me So. That baSe, that cruel action against her hushand, with all its horrid conSequences, perpetually haunts my breast; he might now have been alive, and beyond description happy, if my villainy had been unperpetrated—that way lies the most unfpeakable of horror—ah ! Hendon, let us fly it Sor ever.
In my private connexions, I have learned what I greatly wanted—a proper idea of domestic felicity; there is nothing comparable, my friend, to the union of two Sensible and well cultivated hearts—it is indeed friendship—and it is Something more—what are all the pleaSures, the bustles I have been accustomed to, when put in competition with one evening’s Solid and Substantial Satisfadlion.
I shall henceforth become a very singular man of quality. No forms will be ob-I 4	Served

M)r houSe shall ever be open to the worthy, (tho’ unfortunate) part of my Species, nor shall the first peer in the realm meet with a more welcome reception. They shall have the privilege of enjoying all that affluence can give, without my exadling that Servile and too general price—the lacrifice of their sincerity or veracity— they fiiali not, George, be obliged to laugh at my Lordjhifs jest, however bold or unmeaning. “ I will have no pins stuck upon my sseeve.”—The honest, the generous Sentiments they feel, shall be communicated with all due confidence; nor shall they ever remember my Superiority in the articles of title or fortune; but to refieD, how empty and contemptible thoSe poffeffions, unleSs in conjunction with a noble and enlarged heart.
What woman So capable of entering into all my rational Schemes, as Mrs. Leicester; she who was educated in all

How lifeleSs and unSatisfadlory should I have found the conversation of any other woman—and by betraying the pre-engagement of my affedions, the evil would 1 only have been the more abundantly aggravated.

Mrs, Freeman to Mifs Gibson.
I A M, my dear Penny, under the greatest apprehensions upon Mrs. Leicester’s account ; she is, indeed, Safely delivered from her late unweildy state; but a cough, that has for Some time hung upon her, is in no degree abated, and Freeman Seems to think, there is a strong probability of its stealing upon her lungs.
Lord Clerage has not the least idea of this alarming circumstance—he considers her as now releaSed from every restraint, and looks forward with the utmost confidence.
It would be a dreadful stroke to Mrs. Le Fever,* and an unSpeakable misfortune to the poor children—pretty orphans— three of them, my girl—but they shall never want a protedling roof—I would endeavour to Supply the loSs they would Sustain, Mrs. LeeSon will never forget
her / *
Miss LE FEVER. 179
her godfon—and my.Dord shall give this last boy a claim to his consideration and kindneSs—by the only means, perhaps, in his power.
He is to be christened privately, and IVIr. Clayton will make his exit very Soon afterwards.
The village and adjacent towns are apprised of his intention, and deeply affected by it—Freeman had the care of ^heir healths, indeed; but his Lordship, , Over since his arrival, has been always ready to relieve their hearts from Suffering, either by his interest, bounty, or advice.
I know not which I ought to grieve most at—my friend’s death, or his Lordship’s difappointment; she would attain the final period of all her hopes, fears, and miSe-ry—but his future days must be embittered, by this fecond deprivation of her, now, that by long acquaintance, and the most amiable condud, she has fo infinitely endeared herSelf to his affedions. In 1 6	his
iBo The History or
his hour of gaiety, the lovelineSs of her figure, and the strength and improvement of her understanding, were the only ob* jedls of his admiration ; but he has, during his residence amongst us, had an opportunity of observing the various operations of her most excellent principles, and the uniform SweetneSs of her disposition.
The air may, however, do much for her; and perhaps we may prevail upon her, to take a journey to Bristol.
She is eaSy in her provision, that is one grand Specific, Surrounded by her friends, and may continually amuSe heisielf with the mofl innocent and engaging of companions, her children, for whom she has the tenderest feelings.
She has no violent afflidbion to contend with; from humanity, from a SenSe of her duty, and an inextinguishable Something of regard, that we cannot divest ourSelves of, for So near a relation as a hushand, site left nothing undone, to prolong
Miss LE FEVER. i8i
long or render his existence comfortable; but now the tryal is past; it must be impossible for her to wish the fond tyrant restored ; nor does she affe6l any absurdities. She will, hereafter, have no wayward humours to confult, no unnecessary mortifications to endure; but all will be So Soothing and Salutary, as (I flatter my-Self) will check the progreSs of this most fatal distemper.
My Lord has not yet Seen her. Since she began to fit up; and will be agreeably, Surprised when he does obtain that indulgence, at the amendment in her looks, notwithstanding all her weakneSs; her beauty triumphs over diSeaSe, nay I believe death itSelf, in the first instance, will be incapable of Subduing it.
I wonder what she will Say, when she finds his Lordship is determined to make her an early visit. Can she be free from all that female vanity, you and I are fo much alive to ?—O! how should I exult in the power of my charms, that could
not
182' The History of
not only have retained the attachment of a very fine young gentleman, for So many Successive years, but So perfedtly eradicated every tindure of impropriety from his composition. Can any thing be more flattering, than to behold a proSelyte of one’s own making—a proSelyte to one’s ' irresistible merit—had Such eclat awaited me, my whimsical brain would certainly have been overturned—and yet you will find this equal-minded woman will lament, and make Such an afflidion of the matter, that 1 question if it does not, for Some time, retard the re-establishment of her health.
Freeman, as I have already told you, makes a most valuable hushand ; I amt not Such a wretch, as either to wish to recall the confession, or reSuSe confirming it; he is a very decent figure—has an entertaining turn, and tells a story with Such good nature and drollery, that you would doat upon him: but when I rested that it was only ash and have—nay, that I mySelf almost made the first advances.
MIS'S LE FEVER. iS^
vances, or his humility would have kept him till this blessed moment, for ought I know, at aweful distance—I could half regret yielding mySelf So quietly, even to a situation, that I have jud. SenSe enough to prefer, to whatever I have Seen or known since the hour of my birth.
I should have played off a few airs at least ; or fuppoSe, in order to have wound up the amour with Some Spirit, I had, in the last month of his probation, given him a booby 1 had heartily deSpiSed as a rival; when, having harraffed him Some time, and expoSed him to the danger of a broken head (for your apothecaries are no fwords-men) I might have condescended to a reconciliation, laughed at his folly, and patched up the wedding in a trice; the man, poor foul, would then naturally have concluded, that all his Sufferings were at an end, eSpecially, as I, on the first Setting out, should have aS-Sisted the pleasing deception, till I found him in that kind of Security, that would
render
1S4 The History op
render him most Sensible of a diSagreea-ble change—then rebelling all at once, I should have given him to understand, that Such SupineneSs was never intended for him, I might have brought him to obey my nod, and SubScribe to my absolute Sovereignty.
Instead of which, we are the veriest turtles in nature ; my will undoubtedly is his law; but would you believe it, I am So mean,, as to Suit it to what I am convinced is his’private inclination: So that when he conforms to it with a shew of obliging m.e, he is in reality only obliging himSelf.
But Surely this levity is ill-timed, when my friends health is affeded—yet to anticipate, is to Suffer a double, nay a treble portion of miSery. I must preServe,
I must exerciSe my Spirits, 'for her Sake ; the time is now approaching, my Penelope, when I may with propriety call forth her Smiles, and re-animate a Spark of vivacity in her heart.

Miss LE FEVER. 185
Leicester has been .dead above six months ; and ma.ny a lady haf, in a much shorter period, not only been married to a Second hushand, but So heartily weary of him alSo, as to be equally impatient to rid herSelf of him, in an honest way.
I have only one piece of advice to give you, my dear, and Snail then conclude.
You can never be So foolish as to fall in love with my idle flights ; no, my good girl, if you can diScover one decent feature, in my real charader, as a wife or friend, adopt it, if you pleafe, for your rule of aOion—but never Suffer yourSelf to be misted, by the vanities of even Yours, &c.

Letter XXXI.
From the Same to the Same.
Lord Clerage, as Mr. Clayton, my Penelope, has been admitted to visit his fair mistreSs, Freeman, and we all drank tea vfith her.	A
186	The Historv of
A warm room, and the conversation of friendship, will inSenSibly communicate a glow both to the complexion and heart.
No face was ever fairer than Mrs Leicester’s, no eyes brighter. Softer, or more intelligent. She appeared this afternoon to uncommon advantage ; a blush, more lovely than any thing I ever Saw in nature, adorned her cheek—and her beautifully shading eye-lashes, could not be ' disregarded, her mouth, her teeth, her hair, are just Such as madam Diana is SuppoSed to be distinguished with; her hand and arm (I always wear gloves when Seated near them, to prevent mine from being intirely out of countenance)—but my Lord shall one day deferibe them to you, with very many other striking graces both of perSon and mind.
But her ugly cough would frequently check our admiration, by awakening us to the alarming conSciouSneSs, that even that finished creature was Subject to the common lot of mortality.
She
Miss LE FEVER.
She thanked us all in the Sweetest terms, for our tender care and obliging assiduity towards her—obServing how a few years had branched out mine in particular, as she had no doubt but her children would reap the benefit of my extraordinary partiality for their mother. Mrs.
Le Fever, she added, would be esteemed for her own fake—but her helpleSs innocents, could alone experience the of- ^ sices of benevolence, in pity to their tender age, or from an extention of that friendship, which had been So liberally dealt out to their fond parent. To have them defended from the miSeries of life, and the contagion of ambition and vanity, was her last and most earnest wish.
We endeavoured to divert her thoughts from Such ferious considerations—but she frequently recurred to them, as if to give them their desired impression upon our hearts.
She must be fenSible of her declining state; tho’ she forbears the direft mention '	of
i88 TheHistorvof
of it; and Sought in this moment to convey Some distant preparation to us.
But how prompt we are to fear—w'here v:e So abundantly love. She is visibly better, will get abroad next week, and must Soon recover her uSual cheaistulneSs.
Mrs. Le Fever was not much affecsted by her conversation, by being accustomed to it, I SuppoSe—but, my Lord, Psteeman and mySelf, were Searched to the quick by it“the affiidled lover, looked now on me, and then upon Mrs. Leicester, as if he intreated me to give him that hope, he could not find in his own breast.
We told^ her, Mr. Clayton intended to leave us the latter end of the next week.
She was much concerned at the news— professed her gratitude for the many favours he had conferreci upon her, and best wishes for his future happineSs.
I shall be glad when he is gone, since it is necessary we should be Separated for Some little time, for I fuSpect we shall have, fine work in the farewell Scene—if
we
Miss LE FEVER. 189
we may iudge from what his voice and countenance betrayed in the bare contemplation of it—but I shall adviSe him to flip away without any tender ceremony.
I do not SuppoSe, that ever man had a truer astedion for woman, and they must be happy.
The little fellow has been called Augustus, (theSe great men, have always half-a-dozen great names) after his Lord-ship—tho’ Mrs. Leicester is far from conceiving the reaSon—So Philip by accident, and Augustus by intention, will have e-qual recommendations to his favour.
We had Some difficulty to reconcile the humble mother to So noble an appellation» the very name. Said she, will fill his infant mind with thofe lofty Sentiments, from which I am So anxious to Secure him.
We rallied her upon the only wer.kneSs we had ever discovered her capable of; and begged her to recoiled, that both Cse-Sers and Alexanders followed the plough in her very neighbourhood; and she could
not
igo The SIistorv or
not Surely wish the fate of Augustus to be inferior to theirs; besides, we added, it was Mr. Clayton’s request, who begged she would allow him to be one of the god-fathers, and could not be refuSed.
This last plea overcame her, and she can now boast a Philip, an Augustus, and a Mary (there have been queens of the name. Madam, though perhaps not in Ithaca) in her tender progeny.
^ * * * Lord Clerage has left us—left us in the utmost difconSolation.
Mrs. Le Fever had So much esteem for him, that her regret is heart-felt; I wish It was convenient to let her into his Secret hiStory—but to tell her, would be to tell her daughter (for they can keep nothing from each other but misfortunes) which would be bounding infinitely beyond what is consistent with our preSent views and designs.
We now begin once more to live. Mrs. Le Fever, and Mrs. Leicester, have filled
wp
Miss LE FEVER. 191
up every vacancy at our happy table (except one little place reServed for his lord-ship,) whom I expedt to hear from every day on a new account, and cannot help being alarmed for the conSequence. Yet it cannot Surely be a grievance, to have the proSpedt of being a woman of quality; her nature is Sufceptible of every natural impression, and this can never be resisted if she is human.
Poor Freeman has but an uneaSy time of it; I am incessantly buzzing, either my hopes or my fears, in his honest ears, from the instant he enters the doors, till the moment he quits them : he Smiles most pleasingly at the one, and patheti- ' cally shakes his head at the other.
It is well you live at Some distance; for I am fatisfied you would So approve him for his humanity, his good humour, and twenty other perfedlions, that, in the end, you would wish your friend fairly out of the way, to give yourfelf an opportunity
igt The History of
portunity of Setting your cap at So inucii merit.
But you simple girl you, do you consider, that an attachment like ours, could not be dissolved without much bustle. The long-drawn face, the impending hat-band, how would you encounter them ? to have days and weeks, and months paSs away, yet the remembrance of his Polly unobliterated ; could yon perSevere in Spreading the repeatedly SucceSsleSs bait—no, no, believe me. So much trouble would attend the attempt, that you had better pray Sor the continuance of Mrs. Freeman’s life, and direCt all your allurements to Some other quarter.
I have ran my eye over what I have written, and sind So little in it either to entertain or instrudt, and you know I am passionately fond of both, that I will defer. Sending it in till I can add an account of his Lordship’s proceedings; and lest they should require a large Space of paper.

per, I will break off abruptly, and pur-Sue my avocations.
It is as I apprehended ; Mrs. Leicester is thrown into the greatest consternation, dilemma and ashidlion, imaginable, by Lord Clerage’s declaring, by a note, his intention to visit her.
I undertook his cauSe—
My dear Kitty, Said si consider what is due to yourSelf and family; how precarious your dependence upon the haughty and capricious Lady Catharine; and how much my Lord has already done for you ; you cannot, you ought not to persist in your refuSal of him.
O my mother, O my children, exclaimed she, your interest and happineSs will ever be my leading Spring of adtion— but a Second marriage is contrary to all my resolutions, my principles ; and eSpe^ cially with a man that once So outrage-oussy persecuted and tormented me.

My much valued friend, cried she, interrupting me, you must not eSpouSe So improper a cauSe; when Lord Clerage was pleaSed to honour me with his addresses, I was not the woman I now am. Youth, and unimpaired health, were at least mine, and the interesting incumbrances of domestic life, not only foreign to my possession, but strangers to my-heart. Yet at that very period, only newly reduced from affluence, and un-pradtiSed in the inconveniences of poverty ; with much latent vanity, and an infinite portion of pride, I pronounced him not the man I could make choice of; ■ and shall I now betray rnySelf into So unequal an union. Shall I endeav^our to strike out a Spark of ambition, where no materials have been lodged; it is impossible ; he is still young and gay, how
unfit
/
Miss LE FEVER. 195
unfit a wife must I then be for him ; my' constitution has received Some shocks, that will expoSe me to an early old age, and my vivacity is wholly extinguished ; is there no w^ay of Saving my children, but by Sacrificing mySelf; of making my mother happy, but at the price of my own peace ; or of Satisfying my friends, but by delivering up mySelf to what my very Soul abhors—yet I will Suffer him to behold me, reSumed she, after a short
paufe----wan and drooping as I am, it
must restore him to his reaSon—he shall visit us, my Freeman, and if we cannot accomplish, we will Subdue his wishes.
I was obliged to let her enjoy this flattering hope; it has, my dear, intirely poffeffed her; and I could perceive, that file aftually exulted in her faded charms, ds she viewed herSelf transiently in the glaSs, from considering it as the only means of fecuring her, from what she is So extremely averSe to.
K 2	But

Letter XXXII.
Lord Clerage to Sir George Hendon.
HOW egregioussy ;we deceive our-Selves, George ; my vivacity Seemed indeed to be totally Subdued, but a Single ray of complacence from that Soft power that held it in bondage, has now called it forth to new life and vigour.
I arrived at Brickley about 12 o’clock, and Sent my,compliments to the family of families.
Freeman
Miss LE FEVER. 197
Freeman immediately waited upon me, and with all the worthy rapture. Such Souls as his are only capable of, welcomed me to the place I had So lately quitted.
I enquired after his wife Mrs. Le Fever, but above all, my Mrs. Leicester; he looked a little diScouraging ; I would not however imbibe the mortifying intimation, but determined to judge for my-felf by the reception 1 met with.
I found Mrs. Le Fever, Mrs. Freeman, Philip, Polly, and their beloved mother, all assembled in the well-known parlour.
Without doubt, she had endeavoured to prepare herSelf for the ren-counter, but her countenance nevertheless evinced, that her heart was not wholly unagitated.
Philip, tho’ little turned of three years old, Soon learned to careSs me; and if the mother’s eyes were unpropitious to her lover, 'she beheld his love for her children, with visible approbation.
k 3	We
198 The Hist o r y of
We dined together—she behaved vrith all that eaSe and dignity, I So much admired on my first acquaintance with her. The afternoon declined, yet no proSped of exchanging one interesting Syllable.
I gave Freeman an item—he communicated it to his wife, but not So dexte-rousiy, as to eScape Mrs. Leicester’s observation.
My Lord, Said she, the reServes that are amiable at one age, are abSurd at another; this company and my Self are well apprized of your generous intention ; and, 1 beg we may give the matter a fair diS-cussion in the circle of friendship.
So far from being under the least disadvantage, by complying with my request—your cauSe will be strengthened; you have gained the vshole party, by your unexampled constancy, and other merits, which i will not now enter upon. I only beg to be allowed to paint things as they strike me, and if you can prove my objestions to be frivolous or insig-^
nificant.
Miss L E FEVER. 19^
nificant, I will Submit to the general decision.
We yeilded the point; tho’predetermined to be unconvinced.
It is now Some years, my Lord, reSum-ed she, since you made me the lame noble offer you now condeSccnd to repeat. At that period, my youth, education, and the recent Sufferings of my father, in the cauSe of his country, might in Some degree have excuSed the warmth of your attachment, and reconciled the world to fo unSuitable an union. I was then, however, not only pre engaged in my affedlions, but strongly prejudiced against Some part of your charadter. I refuSed you, my Lord—give me leave to awaken your pride, by re- • peating the indigent Kitty Le Fever, haughtily refuSed you, and married the man of her acknowledged preference. You Surely must recollect all the rage and indignation this treatment occasioned you to feel. That man is now no more, but notwithstanding his body is lodged in the K 4	grave.

grave, his memory lives, and will ever continue to live in his wife’s heart—three children have Survived him, poor unportioned children ; at this moment dependant on the bounty of a woman that has stipulated to withdraw it, if their mother renounces her widowhood. You must remember Kitty Le Fever’s perSon—Mrs. Leicester hardly bears any reSemblance of her—her Spirits are depressed, her mind strongly, strongly disinclined to change her condition, and incapable of loving even your Lordship ; -ought you then to advance Such a being to the participation of your rank and fortune. Nay, this is not all; she has a mother, wshoSe happi-neSs is dearer to her than her own, from whom she is reSolved never to be Separated—what a houSeful of beggars, my Lord, might you boast, if you was to persist in your evidently not well-considered resolution. DiSgusted by the cold behaviour of your wife, and distraded with the noiSe and confusion of her^ Leicester’s
children.
Miss LE FEVER. 201
children, your home would become hateful to you ; and the ridicule of your friends would restrain you from going a-broad; thus would your life become a burthen, and you would riot fail to curSe the hour that had been witneSs to your obtaining So preposterous a wish, as uniting yourSelf to the inconveniences I have described—^you Seem impatient, my Lord, to reply, but weigh well your determination, for your future happineSs absolutely depends upon it.
My dear Mrs. Leicester, cried I, have I not heard you to the utmost, without even attempting to interrupt you? Only allow me the Same privilege, and I have little more to afk. My anSwer, indeed, will not long detain you; I have never tasted felicity since your refuSal (words have no terrors for me, it was the deed that stabbed me to the heart,) of me, nor have I any other jiroSpedt of being restored to it, than by your acceptance of me. 1 love Mrs. Le Fever, your children are K 5	dear
202 The HiSTORy of
dear to me; my fortune is Sufficient for, us all. Your Serious conversation will delight me beyond all the giddy Sallies on earth, and I will never ceafe my Solicitations, until you conSent to be mine.
Her features fell in that peculiar manner that denotes disappointment.
I cannot contend, my Lord, Said she, it is not for me to fight against my own interest. For my mother and childrens fake alone, I wish my days to be prolonged, and what is it that for their Sakes I would not endure ?—But the concession is unworthy your acceptance, and 1 shall think meanly of you, if after what 1 have Said, you can reSolve to make the fortune of even my own dearest relations.—I will retire, and hope to hear you have renounced So ignoble a purpoSe.
She left us, and you may gueSs the re-Sul t.
In about half an-hour’s time, she returned, unSent for, no affedation, no preSumption, I am grieved to perceive
what
Miss LE FEVER. 203
what I cannot but admire, for is it not the strongest mark of cold indifference.
Freeman was disappointed, that I would not take up my residence under his roof, (it would not have been the first time» George,) but Sensible of Mrs. Leicester’s delicate fancies, I had guarded against every diSgusting contingence, by borrowing a friend’s houSe at about four miles distance, during my continuance in the country.
I departed at eleven, and have thought of nothing but my approaching happi-neSs, until this very moment, that I am Setting out to breakfast with my old approved friends. .

She insists upon it, that one year and one month of her widowhood shall e-lapfe, before she is entertained on the Subjedt of a Second love. She kindly promises to do all she can to join inclination to duty, and grows leSs and leSs averSe to the late formidable man.
But, my dear, even whilst she So agreeably amufes us, we cannot be inSensiblethat she is stealing from us, and will too probably be Soon beyond our utmost reach. We consulted a physician yesterday, who is of opinion, that she is in a deep decay.
Two months are yet unexpired of the rime, she requires to be mistreSs of her-Self—but she can never be So near her final dissolution; her frame, her complexion are So delicate, that they deceive every beholder—and are more durable than we imagine, nor will her poor children be left destitute.
My Lord is with us every day. Not a word of love—but friendship, the most exalted friendship is his darling theme.
Mrs.
Miss LE FEVER. 205
Mrs. Le Fever blesses the day that her daughter became acquainted with him, • and will more abundantly bleSs the one that gives him to her for a Ion.
Preparations are already carried on, (tho* without Mrs. Leicester’s knowledge) Lady Catherine has already been applied to; and she declares herfelf not only in the Same mind with reSpedl: to the Seven thouSand pounds, but offers to make it ten, and Settlements are to be drawn accordingly. Death, all-tremendous death? forbear to interrupt So noble a work.
Poor Freeman—shall I tell you how fond he is grown of a little quality hindingy my Lord, and your Lordship, is perpetually falling from his lips; and I shrewdly fuSped, he enjoyed lefs fatisfadlion, (an ungrateful wretch) in the contemplation of his own great day, than he experiences in that of his Lordship’s.
1 wish he may not have reaSon to repent the notions I shall imbibe upon the occasion. To be So courted, who would not
be
2o6 The H i s t o r y o r
be a widow? To be So provided for, who would not be a Second time diSpoSed of?—Yet he may as well live—inferior and imperfect as he is, in comparison of his great benefadtor—for you know, Penelope, as I am not a Mrs. Leicester, I might too probably sigh out the remainder of my existence in Solitary diScontent.
My Lord propoSes, if her i.adyship (my heart dances at the Sound,) can undertake the journey, to carry her to the German Spaw—the Bantlings and Mrs. Le Fever to remain at Brickley.
Her Ladyship must have a companion of her own Sex, to render the expedition pleasing—many a female would be glad of Such an opportunity of Seeing the world, and but one, my dear, can be So happy as to enjoy it—can you not gueSs who that one may be-—even honest Freeman’s wife, if he can prevail upon himfelf to Support her abSence for So long a period. But he has always made a point of preferring her
Iiappinefs
Miss LE FEVER. 207-
happineSs to his own, she has therefore, nothing to fear from that quarter.
I could never have been convinced of the power of dreSs, but from ocular de-_ monstration. Mr. Clayton had the utmost appearance of a Sober, worthy gentleman—but Lord Clerage is quite the a-greeable man of quality—that ever my friend could refuSe him and make choice of—there is no accounting for fancy, and I ought to be Silent.
Mrs. Leicester has just left me, she is weak and low-Spirited; I felt the fiiock, and Severely cenSured mySelf for the folly I had been pradising ; and to add to my mortification, fne expressed a desire to read what I had written.
You know my disposition. Said I, I was all hope in the moment I exerciSed my pen, and my stile is consistent with its dictates. But your paleneSs and dejedion have given Such a new turn to my thoughts, that I mySelf could not bear to run it o-
ver.
- 2oS The History of
ver, judge then how unfit'it must be for your peruSal.
My dear Freeman, cried she, \Vhy will you Suffer yourfelf to be So groSsly missed by idle delusions; it is not my wedding, but my funeral, you will be called to attend. I feel mySelf die daily, tho’ I would Spare you as much as possible, if I did not fear the stroke would be the heavier by your being unprepared for it. I cannot have many weeks longer to continue with you; yet you leave me to perform the taste of resigning mySeif to the awful change alone and unassisted. You will behold death as an enemy, and sty the idea of him with horror; but there is a method to diSarm him of his terrprs, and teach us to welcome him as our tendefest friend. I will sit down with you, and for once Speak all that is in my heart. You have been an eye-witneSs of the inconveniences, the fond affedion of poor Leicester, frequently expoSed me to; they could not always be concealed. You may
remember
Miss LE FEVER. 209
remember how wifely I thought I had choSen—and how I hugged the dear deceitful expedation of a long Succession of shappineSs. You was likewife privy, in Some meaSure, to my disappointment; Mr. Leicester was not proof against the only infirmity of his nature, jealouSy, and that was the Source of every error—he was taken away, however—and 1 am left to accomplish my last great work without interruption ; nor should I find it difficult, if you did not all conSpire against me—you are affeded—ah I this is ever the cafe—and I must die in fildnce, and leave you comfortleSs.
Freeman came in at this jundure; his wife’s tears were too precious to be disregarded by him—but when he heard the cauSe he could have joined his own—and to avoid that strongest evidence of humane Sensibility, he hurried out of the apartment.
What will be the event of all theSe threatening appearances, heaven only
knows I

Lord Clerage—how would you compassionate him ? is utterly hopeleSs—yet has he the reSolution to preServe an outward compoSure; he Seldom indeed Speaks but with his eyes—and they are abundantly anxious and inquisitive.
She
Miss LE FEVElt. 211
She is Subjedl to violent faintings, in one of which Freeman SuppoSes she will go off.
And can I not only write, but behold Such heart-woundins; characters—I am callous, my dear, at preSent, but depend upon it the last stroke will not be unfelt.
I no longer wonder at all the elegies? the beautiful complaints your poets,whoSe Souls have been touched, have laid before us. I myfelf could for ever dwell upon the excellencies, the merits of my Sweet-departing friend. But let me not rob her of one moment’s due attendance—I can: write to you, when she, alas 1 is. beyond, my utmost care.
Yeti will give you the changes, the operations of this cruel undermining, in-..' v curable diSorder, as opportunity , offers.
I have much to engage my tender attention. Lord Clerage, Mrs. Le Fever,, my hushand—but who shall Sooth my woes, or from whence can they derive the
Slightest
'	212 TheHistorvof
fiightest mitigation—the power alone that inssidls them, can relieve them.
She is dying at this very period, in that stow peculiar manner of consumptions, tho* not yet confined to her bed ; nor will she be prevailed upon to deny herSelf the sight of her children.
She has had a Severe fit this very morn-ing—we all imagined it would have been her last—but she fell into a gentle steep, from which I hope she will awake refreshed.
She Sends for me—I will not treSpaSs an instant upon that patience, that is Sufficiently executed by Suffering.
Let me, let me. Penny, endeavour to deScribe Such a Scene to you, as Sure no mortal was ever before a Spedlator of.
I entered Mrs. Leicester’s apartment trembling—perhaps, thought I, I am only called to behold her last agonies—but I found her Seated in her eaSy chair, with a chearfulneSs of aSped, I could little have expeded.
My
Miss LE FEVER. 213
My Freeman, Said she, with a quick (and for her strong) voice, where is Lord Clerage; I must See him this instant; tell him I intreat it as a particular favour, and I am certain he will oblige me.
I Soon brought him, agreeable to her desire.
My Lord, Said she, I am perSuaded it was your intention to have made my life happy, you will not then, I hope, hesitate to render my death So. It is not proper you should now Solicit me—and the circumstances I am under. Sets me above all form—I may SurpriSe you—but I now earnestly intreat you to accept that hand you have hitherto been reSuSed. Was I not intirely convinced of your merit, even at this late hour, I would diSdain the union—but you deServe my thanks, you de-Serve my prayers. Tell me then, will you conSent to relieve rriy mind from its, extremest anxiety—I See your Lordship’s distreSs, your tears. Freeman, greatly disturb me; nor shall 1 have the strength to
bestow
GI4 The Historv of
bestow my poor weak hand, if I am Iiap-pily Successful in my application, unleSs you can reSolve to assist and Support me.
, My Lord took her hand as it was dropping upon the arm of the chair—kissed it 'Cagerly; and I could perceive, shed Some tokens of affection upon it, that could not fail to be grateful.
It is too much, my Lord, too much my friend. Said she—but you must be expeditious ; let the licence be procured, let the Settlements be Signed; whoever expedted 1 should quicken your Lordship in Such a cauSe—but we will not Spend that time in expedtations, that ought to be employed to a much better purpoSe. The worthy Freeman shall give me away—my mother, all my friends shall be preSent— nor will the ceremony be long in performing, when once the necessary preparations are accomplished;
She hurried us away; me to inform Freeman, and Mrs. Le Fever of what
Miss LE FEVER. 215
was to happen, and his Lordship to get the licence.
He pressed my hand as we went down stairs—we will Support it. Said he—bitter as the trial is, it shall be Sustained—I fancy I can gueSs her motives—she is an angel—I have not deServed her—wretch that I am—but I will not complain.
We returned ; she eagerly enquired if every thing was ready.
My most precious woman, Said his Lordship, do Spare yourSelf this violent exertion of your Spirits—all is as you could wish—the parchments ready for Signing, and—he could not Speak the rest.
There must be no delays. Said she, let them be duly executed, and we will then proceed to the other ceremony.
The lawyer was immediately introduced, and that busineSs being Speedily, tho’ Solemnly diSpatched—his Lordship produced a private bond or instrument, which he begged of me to witneSs, and the
gentle-
2i6 The Historv of
gentleman’s clerk was called in to do the Same, but I am ignorant of the contents.
Mrs. Leicester desired Some drops— my treacherous Ipirits, cried she, are beginning to forSake me ; they must bea ffist-ed, or disappointment will at last be my portion.
In about ten minutes time she reSum-ed, her former earnestneSs—the clergyman—we all assembled—but Such a marriage was hardly ever performed before— .every one but the bride was in the deepest distreSs—however, her reSolution continued unshaken until all was over, and every form fubmitted to render the union valid.
My Lord kissed her hand again and ' again,- in the anguish of defpair—and her mother retired to give vent to her long restrained afflidlion.
She now dropped near to fainting; my hushand and his Lordship would have withdrawn—but she befought them to let
her
Miss L E FEVER. 217
her finish her work, as she could not ex_ pedl to enjoy many more opportunities;.
Your Lordship, Said she, when she had Somewhat recovered herSelf, cannot but penetrate my motives for the Extraordinary steps 1 have taken. Lady Catharine consented to buy me a title, but she will purchaSe me the Sweetest of conSolations, The deception is not only innocent, but justifiable; I have conformed to her terms, and she cannot refuSe the rew^ard. My» mother, my children will never preSume to claim an alliance, which you. Sir, will be too generous ever to forget; and by Securing Such a friend to them, I die per-fedtly Satisfied, and will thank you for your goodneSs and condeScenSion, even with my latest breath.
My lovely creature, cried his Lordship, you may Spare yourSelf all farther explication. Your-design, your view, was too obvious to be mistaken—and it must be a Satisfadion to you to find, that the man you have So greatly honoured, as to chooSe
VoL. II.	L	for

Freeman obeyed this command, and I had the pleafure to find, that his Lordship bestowed the ten thouSand pounds, he was to receive from Lady Catharine, equally amongst the pretty orphans.
It is compleated, my Lord, cried the delighted Mrs. Leic.ester, (laying her feeble hand upon his in a grateful preS-Sure,) you have accomplished my every wish. Now all the difficulty is over—and another day or tv/o, and I shall be—but you will vouchsafe to write to her Ladyship, and I could be glad to know the money was Safely deposited.
What a happineSs, that the writings had been prepared, (a circumstance which Mrs. Leicester dr«w out of me only the

Four days have passed away, yet is this lovely, glimmering lamp un-cxtinguished. My Lord Seldom quits her apartment in the day-time; he reads to her; he administers her medicines, and is to receive the Sacrament with her. So Soon as the messenger returns frona Lady Catharine.
She expresses Some little impatience, now and then, at her Ladyship’s delay— she is, indeed, unacquainted with the anguish of her preSent condition, she knows notlsing of maternal anxiety—hut Surely L 2	her
‘220 The HiSTORy or
her politcnefs to Lord Clerage, should have induced her to be expeditious in her congratulations—she cannot depart until her anSv/er is received.
The messenger is at last arrived, with a particular draught upon her Ladyship’s banker for the promiSed Sum; and now, as my friend expresses it, she has nothing to do, but to die.
She has performed all that she intended—has taken leave of her children, and his I.ordship received every one from her as his own—she has charged me to remember her mo|:her-r—but what will ber come of me, when I forget mySelf?
I am, &c. ■

Letter XXXVI.
Mr. Freeman to Mifs Gibson,
Madam,
1A M enjoined, by my wife, to inform you of thofe particulars she is une qua] to,	Mrs,
Miss LE FEVER. 221
Mrs. Leicester, or rather Lady Cler-age, has just breathed her last. She was dying last night, tho’ perfedlly in her Sen-Ses; and about six o’clock in the morning she expressed a desire to See my Lord.
She intreated him to be comforted; and to endeavour to Support her dear mother under her affliftion.
Mrs. Le Fever would have entered the room, as alSo my wiSe; but she ordered the nurSe to admit no ocher perSon than his Lordship and me.
My Lord, Said she. In a very low voice, perhaps you never Saw any one die; did you not expedt the Scene to be much more , dreadful than you find it. You are still a very young gentleman, and may live to loSe the remembrance of what even now So strangely affedls you—but I owe you— I owe you, reSumed she after Some moments struggling, a proper impression of tlsss inevitable change. ThoSe that forget they are to die, will never live as they ought to do—you will not only retain, L 3	but
\
222 The HisTORy or
but communicate the lesson to my poor children. Do not be diScouraged from the praftice of virtue, becauSe all her votaries are not So happy as might be ex-pC(51;ed, I mySelf fell a vidtim in the first instance to filial affedtion—but does not that very confciouSnefs at this moment Smooth my bed of languishment, and cheer my poor drooping Spirits—would we have the joys of mortality, and the blessed rewards of eternity to be ours—preSumptu-ous, and unreasonable wretches! I could never have been uSeful to you in life, added she, after another interval of Sussering, bur reap all the benefit of my departure, and let both your heart and Soul be reformed.	'
Slie lay for half an hour vfithout Speaking, and 1 prevailed upon his Lordship to retire, lest the fight of him should disturb her, if she did once more recover her fen-Sibility,
She did again lift up her eyes, my mo» ther, my children, ray God, pronounced
Miss LE FEVER. 223
ced she, very imperfeftly—when falling into a fuccession of her faintings, she was at length Subdued, never more to be restored to us.
You will kindly excuSe my enlarging upon So melancholy a Subje<5l. Never was there a more afflidted family, or indeed I own, for she is univerSally lamented.
I am to acquaint his Lordship’s friend. Sir George Hendon, of his circumstances—he has for Some time been incapable of writing himfelf—but I hope his constitution will not yield to the violence of his grief.
Mrs. LeeSon fends us word she will come down, attended by her faithful Jenny, and pafs the remainder of her days with us, and exerciSe her best endeavours to conSole us all.
Can we, my dear. Madam, prove unmindful of Such a memento—could prayers or tears, or friends or fortune have prevailed, Mrs. Leicester had obtained a
happy
224 The Historv, &c.
happy reSpite from this awful Scene—but we may learn this piece of home philoSo-phy, from her being torn So fatally from us—how insufficient and vain all human attempts, to avert the inevitable fate^f all created beings.
I am, &c.
C, Freeman.
