your r---- h----. I am inSenfible to
every other wish than that of gratifying the desires of a man whom 1 adore. To-morrow, at four o’clock, I shall be at-’s
in Sackville-street, where I shall wait, with the utmost impatience, the honour of Seeing you. Harriot will be as fiiithful as she is affiduous. Perliaps I am imprudent in ligning mySelf, what, however, I cannot avoid,

My charming angel,
By a horrid mistake, which I will hereafter explain, 1 did not receive the last favour, till half an hour after the appointed hour of meeting; but unwilling to lofe even the chance of an opportunity of testifying my attachment, I lost not a moment in repairing to --from whence
you had been retired Some minutes. I was hardy enough to follow you to — Square, and stiould even have entered your houSe, but that I Saw his lordship, with three of his friends, advancing immediately before me. Prudence therefore forbad that gratification which love had otherwife demanded. To-morrow, at fix o’clock, you will find captain--at that fide of Bucking-
ham gate next ChelSea. You know the rest ; but you do not know how sincerely I am
Your ladyship’s most obedient. Most devoted and most faithful humble Servant,

Alas Madam ! what lhall I Say ! lam ^ not leSs enraptured with your perSon, than charmed with your punctuality. The mistake was a horrid one ! and the fault was all my own; instead of Buckingham , gate, I should have written Constitution hill: Will you, can you, pardon me ? I have nothing to offer, in mitigation of my crime, but that, transported with the enchanting idea of clafping you in my arms,
I could not write like a man in his fenfes.
I will be at Drury-lane this evening, and, if you are not too much irritated, Sliall fee you in the ufual part of the houfe. Forgive me, if poffible.

My chagrin, Sir, at not finding the captain at the place mentioned in your letter, can be equalled by nothing but that which I experienced, when I found you did not come to the play neither. Indeed, Sir, I am not to be thus trifled with; my Spirit revolts at the idea ; and though I would have preferred a cottage with you, to a palace with any other perSon, yet your

Your last cruel letter found me on the point of taking post-chaiSe for London, where I am no Sooner arrived, than I fit down to alTure you that my fentiments are wholly unchanged; that I am incapable of change, and that, if you have not heard from me as frequently as uSual, it ought not to be attributed to any alteration in my fentiments, but to a SenSe of the importance of the commifiion with which I was charged, which would not admit of my thinking a moment on any other Subject. ExcuSe this freedom, madam, in an Engiistiman and a Subject. Tomorrow, if you pleaSe, at eleven o’ clock, I will have the honour of throwing my Self
at your feet in----street j and of this
my intention I will immediately apprize

I Had Scarcely prevailed on mySelf to hear the conSolations which my vroman offered on the misery of my being dragged to this place, ‘ when I received your r— h—s’s letter by the hands of the landlord of the Red-lion, who, I believe, is a man that may be trusted. To prevent, however, all postibility of any accident which might happen from your letters being conveyed through this channel, I beg that in future ,
your r--- h--—^ will direct “ToMifs
Anne Robinfonj to be left at the post-office in —, hill called for.” By this means all Search will be eluded, and every attempt towards a diScovery be rendered wholly ' fruitless. The clergyman whom you recommended to my lord is greatly in favour, and I am in hopes that his reverence may be made uSeful.
Yours, yours truly. N. B. The above letter has no Subscription.

My Sweet angel!
IT is not in the power of language to cx-prcSs the ardent desire I have of prostrating mySelf at your feet. Every moment of your absence I esteem an age; and if your brute of a lord does not Soon take the resolution of coming to London, I fhall certainly take that of visiting your feat in the country. Your ladystiip would think this an impolitiek step, but be not alarmed : if it Should be necestary, depend 'on my prudence and management for finding an excufe for the visit, which might .paSs on a wiSer man than your lord, — curSe on the word ! I am tormented to think that there Should be any legal obstruction to the full gratification of our wishes: for I am, with the sincerest, most ardent, and most perSevering pasiion,

My good fortune. Sir, has prevented a most fatal accident: your last letter fell into his lordShip’s hand, and he communicated it to my mother; who had no Sooner read it, than, with a prudence and foresight peculiar to herSelf, She told his lordstiip that it was certainly intended for one of the Servant-maids ; with which cxcuSe he Seemed contented, and departed. My mama immediately Sent for me, and ‘taxed me with infidelity, but, at the Same ' time, promised that She would diScover nothing, if I would vow an eternal reformation. You may be certain I did not hesitate. But, for the Sake of all that is dear to me in this world, be cautious in future. I will be in ----street at twelve to-mor-

My dear madam,	TueSday noon*
IF I could not have the happinefs of teeing you yesterday, it must not be attributed to any designed neglect on my part, but to the indiSpensible obligation I was under of attending a council, which was held precisely at the hour which ycu were obliging enough to six on, and of which I
had not ten minutes previous notice.--
-----------------If you can make it convenient to be at the Star and Garter at ChelSea, to-morrow, at four o’clock, you will most asturedly find me there; but if any thing Should happen to prevent your attendance, you may be astured that I stiall put the most favourable construction on the , matter, and regretting only the loSs of your Sweet company, think nothing of the time I may Spend there in the hope of enjoying it, for I am, madam, with the most perfect and inviolable attachment,

Dearest of creatures!
TH E favour of your company yesterday I ought to acknowledge with the most Sincere gratitude. I do acknowledge it; and I rccal the idea of the happy moments we pasted together, with a rapture which none but the most sincere of lovers can be capable of feeling. I know your engagements for this evening; and you know the prudential reaSons which prevent my being at the Same place. To-morrow at six o’clock, I am engaged with you know whom, to go to Woolwich, to See the launch of the new Seventy-four gun strip. Alas ! I had rather be witneSs to a launch of another kind.

I know how his lordship has engaged him-- felfj So that you have nothing to fear.
LETTER XVI.
My dear Sir!
Allow me to call you by that ten« der name, since our acquaintance now is, or ought to be, established on So firm a basis, as to banish all distinctions. You know how dear you are to me : you know alfo, that it is time for me to consider my-felf as one who has Some claim to your affectionate regard. Indeed I have no doubt but I am beloved by you ; and, in this confidence, I have bad adieu to all thoSe considerations which would have had weight D	with
C 18 ]
with the majority of my Sex. It is not probable that I shall have the happineSs of your company for fix weeks at least ; oh ! what a tedious time ! we are going to our
Seat in --shire, from whence, I believe,
we shall not return till after the Christmas holidays. If any method could be deviSed, by which I could Safely correSpond with you, it would be Some alleviation to the distreSs which I must Suffer by my abfence from the man whom I hold most dear; from the man who is indeed the prince of my affections.

LETTER XVII.
Angel of a woman !
YO'IJ R last obliging letter has at once given me more pain, and afforded me more Satisfaction, than all the preceding. The thought of losing you for six weeks torments me beyond description, while the affurance you give of the sincerity and constancy of your regard, Serves as a healing balm to the wound. I flatter mySelf that
there
[ o ]
there will be no difficulty in our maintain-ing a correspondence, that ffiall not be even
fubjedl to Suspicion. The village of-------
is within two miles of your feat; the landlord of the White Bear at that place was formerly in the Sea Service; and he now enjoys the benefit of half pay through my mediation; So that he is devoted to my Service, and I will instantly take Such measures, that your letters may be Safely left with him, and will engage that he ffiall deliver mine in return into the hands of the faithful girl whom your ladyffiip has So often trusted. But I flatter myfclf that a mutual correspondence will not be all. I
can easily steal to----— in the depth of
the night; and if your ladyffiip can prevail on yourSelf to walk, unattended, to that village, I See no reaSon why I may not have the happinefs of throv/ing niyfelf at your feet any morning, when his lordffiip i	is engaged with a hunting party. Think

LETTER XXIX.
My dear —~
TH E day after you left London, I received authentic intelligence that his lordShip had determined to litigate the affair in-- Commons. I knew not what
step to take, and therefore patiently Submitted to my fate. I knew that a week would make very little difference in an affair, which the gentlemen of the robe were to be concerned' in; and therefore did not i trouble you with any letter during your absence, unwilling as I was to disturb that repoSe which I hoped you would enjoy in • the courfe of your tour. I hope it has not
been

been a diSagreeable one, and that you are , returned in perfect health to London. I
just now learn that his ---p is reSolved.to
carry matters to the utmost-extremity, and to take every advantage that the laws will afford him. In this conjuncture, therefore, rbeg your advice!, by which I will be wholly guided. I think it would not -be prudent for you to attempt teeing me, or to Send any more letters, except a final' one, hovv you intend to act in this critical
emergency.
:	I am,
with the warmest attachment, unalterably yours,
