THE
P R E F A C E.
CUSTOM may be complied with in any thing that is, in itfelf, just or reafonable. I am no , enemy to it, when a compliance therewith is not contrary to reaSon.
\
According to custom, therefore, is _■ this Preface given : yet that is not the only reaSon. I thought it was abshlutely neccffary, by way of introduction, to give fome account of the following Letters.
A 2	As
vi	PREFACE.	^
As they were not at first designed to be published, but wrote by Mr.^ Guildford for my ufe, and the peru-	j
Sal of a few friends that I Should think proper to oblige with a fight ^	|
of them, it is hoped the reader will	!
cxcufe any errors he may find in them and remember, that they were wrote by one friend to another, and not to the public.	.	'
Had Mr. Guildford designed them for that ufe, I doubt not but he would have wrote them in a different stile, and not in So free a manner; for the language Seems to be varied throughout, according to the Subject he is upon, and his pen might, perhaps. Sometimes be influenced by ^ the humour he was in at the time of writing.
,'	Grave
PREFACE. V
Grave and Sublime Subjects he treats with dignity, and a language Suitable thereto; Love Subjects in-a very different manner Sometimes in drollery, often in ridicule. As to his regard for the Lady mentioned in the following letters, it was real. Such as was worthy of the object, and which a man need not bluSh to own. As to his own behaviour, or what he, in Some of his letters, writes on that palTion called Love, the reader mult look on it in a proper light. His in-I ' *■ tent, in many places, being Satire on I	the innumerable instances of folly.
Seen in thoSe who pretend to be, or fancy themSelves in love.
As to Mr. Guildford’s fortitude on many occasions, where the reader, in the courfe of the following letters A3	will
vi PREFACE.
will find he had great reafon to exert it; it was greater than what is there i mentioned, yet he met with many Severe trials which almost overcame it.
I must further obServe, that had Mr. Guildford originally designed thefe letters for the peruSal of the - public, feveral things would have been omitted, as he himfelf informed me afterwards, when he came to ' perufe them, but which as they were wrote, must remain So.
He faid it would be only esteem-, ed by the vulgar, as an incoherent, ill-digested medley, as it now stands.
I told him, I thought otherwife, and mentioned the works of feveral famous authors, and the fuccefs they met with among the judicious part of the world; and,^ I added, that
A
PREFACE. vii
any man of common SenSe, would, on perusing it, easily perceive the i design of the whole.
His often deScending So low, and ' then again rising (as emerging from a cloud) to his native language, which is free, simple, and eafy, greatly pleaSed me, being Such as might rea-1 Sonably be fuppoSed to pafs between two friends. So clofely connected, as-Mr. Guildford and mySelf.
He mentioned the Satyrical characters he had given me, but I made, uSe of his own arguments, in his 23d letter. Several other objections j he raifed,but I anfwer them to the best: of my judgment. '
I	I hope the reader will not in the
whole, think his time entirely lost
in
viii PREFACE.	I
in perusing this work, as it is chiefly	I
designed to pleafe and instrudl, and that in a very extensive Senfe. There are many beautiful and just reflexions, and Some found learning in it. Some agreeable adventures, and an account of many curiosities, &c. in France and Italy, which Mr. Guildford took from his own private memorandums, and mentioned chiefly for diversion, ef-, pecially the Romifh relicks.
The characters he has given are all English, one or two excepted. He thought it was needlefs to mention any others. Vice and Folly being the Same in all parts of the world, and operating in the fame manner, at least there is little material difference. ThoSe that conSult Le Brun will find, that the paffions operate alike in all mankind ^ thoSe that read
Locke
•	I-
PREFACE. ix
[ Locke will be convinced, that all ' mankind gain knowledge, whether 1 of Good or Evil, in the Same man-ner. The effects muff, therefore, be nearly the Same in a Frenchman, an Italian, or a Turk, as in an Englishman. The characters are true, and will Suit many in real life, not only in this ifland, but on the continent alSo. The effects, circum-ffances, 5cc. are all true, to Mr. Guild-■ ford’s certain knowledge. Some of them to mine. That the whole may appear in a proper manner, things ^ and circumffances are mentioned as they happened, and you generally fee the caufe, before you know the effects.
There are alfo fome criticifms, which may not be difpleafing to the curious or judicious reader. All that I can
farther

farther add, is, That it is design’d to divert the public, which,” as Swift fays, ‘‘ perhaps the gentle, courteous, and candid reader, brim-ful of that modern charity and ten-« derneSs, ufually annexed to his oF ** office, will be very hardly per-shaded to believe.”

Mr. Charles Guildford.

desire me to give you an 1®^ Y ^ account of my life, at least of k	the chief tranSadtions of it. I
j&Js can deny nothing to So tender a friend, but greatly fear the Small pleaSure you will receive in the peruSal, will not in the least compenSate for your j trouble of reading; but as you request it, I shall readily comply.
VoL. I.	B V	1 was
' i -
2 M E M O I R S of
I was born at *	a country vil-
lage, about one hundred miles from London, where my father then resided, in a Small yet genteel habitation. .Dwas situated in a pleaSant country, that was adorned with a native beauty far Surpassing the laboured art of man. In short, our habitation, and the country Surrounding us, was one of the most delightful Scenes I have ever Seen ; that is, where nature alone, and not art, contributed to render it agreeable.
My father had a Small estate adjoining, Sufficient to Support our family, (which consisted of him, my mother, a Sister, whoSe name was Lucy, of the Same age with me, being both the fruits of one birth, myfelf, and three domestic Servants) in a moderate yet genteel manner.
My Sister, when she was arrived to an age capable of imbibing the first rudiments of education, was Sent to a neighbouring boarding-School of great reputation ; for our parents were reSolved to Ipare no costs as far as they were able, to give both Lucy and myfelf a genteel and liberal education.
At this School my sister, though young, contracted a very great friendship with
MiSs
Mr. Charles Guildford. 3
MiSs Charlotte Worthy, a young lady nearly of the Same age with herSelf, daughter to a gentleman of fortune, who resided near us.—Of their friendship I shall have occasion to take more particular notice hereafter.
As for me, my early years were Spent under the tuition of my father, who, as a careful and tender parent, would not trust the education of me to any but himSelf.
His chief aim and endeavours were to instil into my heart the most humane and generous principles.—To render me master of all the Social virtues, and give me as true and just an idea of religion as he possibly could ; to prevent my falling into the common errors and prejudices which we often imbibe in our infancy concerning mankind, the world, and all thoSe various objedts that daily Surround us in the buSy Scenes of life, and which prejudices Sometimes are So deeply rooted in us, that when we are grown up to manhood, they ar« Scarce ever eradicated but commonly appear in all our actions.—If they are at any time rooted out, it is with the greatest difficulty, and costs the Suffering patient many a painful moment.—To think justly of things, and B 2	to
4 M E M O I R S of
to distinguish and judge with the utmost accuracy of the merit and demerit of whatever offered itSelf to my view, was the conSequence he desired should enSue from my tollowing his excellent instructions. A Serious refiedtion on whatever I either Saw, read, or heard, (if of Sufficient moment to engage my attention) was what he at all times earnestly recommended to me.
To confine the affedlions of my foul within due bounds, was another great article he strongly recommended, in order to prevent them from degenerating into unruly and vicious passions.
No Sooner was I master of thoSe things requisite for my entering upon the study of the liberal Sciences, than my father Supplied me with books, mathematical instruments, &c. and adviSed me to pur-fue my studies therein with the greatest diligence, assuring me, that I must make mySelf master of fome art, (the choice of which he would leave entirely to myfelf) wheSewith I might gain a competent fub-sistance for life, as I had nothing to depend upon but his fmall patrimony, part of which must go to my sister; and if he should have any more children, they
must
Mr. Charles Guildford. 5
must in iustice have their proportions; that therefore my situation in life was very precarious, and I shad little dependance but on my own industry.
My father had given me a pretty competent knowledge of the dead languages, though we had not Spent much rime upon them, as he had taught me after a different method from,what is generally uSed in the Schools.
French and Italian v/ere now mixed with my other studies, and I became in a short time a tolerable proficient therein.’
During the courSe of my studies, he often, for my fumre condudt in life;, re-comntended to me not only the study of books, but of mankind themSelves, advising me to obServe the faults and failings of others with a curious eye; and whenever I should perceive any thing arniSs in them, to examine mySeff, fee if I was not guilty of the like ; and make ufe of their failings, as a mark to prevent my Splitting on the Same (Sometimes imperceptible) rocks.
He would often Speak to me to this purport, “ My dear Charles, youth can-“ not So easily perceive the follies of man-“ kind, and the ridiculous parts they a6t " B 3	“in
6 M E M O I R S of
“ in life, as old age ; but the hoary head “ that has gained wiSdom and knowledge “ from experience, often can, if not per-fedly, at least much better than un-wary youth, who commonly view things “ through the wrong end of the per-“ Spedtivc, and thoSe vices which to ex-“ perienced age are evident, and plainly “ visible, to youth Scarce appear legible. “ They only view the external of things, and carry not their Speculations So far “ as the internal.
“ As many advantages in life will ac-“ crue to you from studying mankind, . “ their morals, manners, passions, virtues “ and vices, be as perfedt in that part as ** you possibly can, and let not any oppor-“ tunity paSs of acquiring wifdom and “ knowledge in general; Such, I mean, “ as will be really uSeful.
“ As for that curious knowledge in “ the Sciences, which many now So anx-“ ioussy Seek after, and which is really “ of little or no concern to any but the “ professors X of each reSpedlive Science, “ being rather a trifling amuSement, to ‘‘ avoid it; for the life of man is short “ enough, and ought not to be Spent in ‘‘ the purSuit of thofe things which do
“ not
[
Mr. Charles Guildford. 7
“ not in the least tend to the welfare and “ happineSs of an intelligent and rationa “ being.”
As my father was one of the most indulgent parents, and always behaved to me with the kindneSs of a friend, rather than the harsh Severity of a father : and as I entertained the highest esteem for him, and for thoSe excellent precepts he daily gave me, I therefore hearkened to him with the utmost attention, carefully obferving whatever he Said; and if I did not at any time rightly comprehend the whole of what he had endeavoured to inculcate, upon my desiring an explanation, he would with the greatest affability comply with my request, glad to See me So obServant, and So desirous of gaining uSeful knowledge.
What he often particularly recommended to my constant pradlice in life, was the keeping every affair of moment a Secret in my own breast, without ever intrusting it to any one ; especially if there was a bare possibility that the diScloSing it could be any ways prejudicial to me.
To keep my inclinations and predominant passions a Secret was another precept he taught me, by which means I B 4	should
\
8 MEMOIRS of
should often frustrate the attempts of thoSe who should at any time strive to make me anxious and uneaSy. The pov/er mankind have of rendering life diSagree-ble to each other, is by that means very much weakened. They know not how to work upon the passions of a man who thus conceals them, and therefore cannot So easily draw him into many follies, and even vices, of which, perhaps, he would not otherwise be guilty.
Another rule was to consider well of past and preSent occurrences, and intervening circumstances, and from thence learn to form a pretty just idea, and a tolerable gueSs of things in futuro.
In the Sam.e neighbourhood with us resided one Mr. Brown, a gentleman of a moderate fortune, who was an intimate friend of my father’s, and had a very great regard for me.
H’e v/as a man of letters, and had taken a particular pleafure in Instrudling me in many uSeful branches of le-arning. It was by h’s advice I Spent Some part of my time in the study of botany and physic ; and with his assistance made many curious experiments, in assaying the virtues of herbs and plants, &c. not only thofe-of •	the
Mr. Charles Guildford. 9
the natural produdl of our own Soil, but alSo many of foreign growth.
Under his care, and my father’s, I became a tolerable linguist, a pretty good mathematician, a botanist, and knew Something of philoSophy, alSo of medicine, and master of Several other things, which I afterwards found highly necef-Sary, in the different Scenes of life through which I passed.
Mr. Brown taught me many very valuable Secrets in physic, which he had himSelf found out, in the courSe of his studies, and which were afterwards of infinite Service to me.
Having made a Sufficient progreSs in thoSe arts and Sciences I had particularly studied, and taken a curSory view of ar-chitedlure and painting, I made choice of thoSe for my future studies and pro-I	Session.
I	I acquainted my father and Mr. Brown
j	of the choice I had made, who both ap-
proved of it, especially Mr. Brown, who j	was very glad my choice happened to fall
on thoSe arts in whjch he was more particularly verSed, than in any of the others, for he vras not only well acquainted with the theory, but alfo vreli verSed in the B 5	pradical

' Mr. Charles Guildford. ii
LETTER II.
IN my last I mentioned my studying of Architedture and Painting, under the care of my friend Mr. Brown; and with his assistance I made great improvement in thoSe arts.
This was the happiest part of my life. Could I for ever have remained So! But .no; stwas impossible ! fate Seemed to have otherwise determined!
My Sister had often mentioned miSs Worthy to me, and greatly extolled her Beauty, her lively wit,, and the Solidity of her judgment. I was young. Saw little company; nor did I desire to
contradt a large acquaintance.--The
world had not any charms for me. The gay pleasures of the town, wshich I had often heard mentioned, appeared to m e dull and insipid; nor v/as beauty itSelfs at least Such as I had already Seen of power Sufficient to move me.
My father and mother had each of them received a very genteel and liberal education far Surpassing thoSe of their rank in life. This was what I confeSs, often puzzled me, to think from whence ,	,	B 6	it
I
)
12 M E M O I R S of
it should proceed ; as I had never heard other mention made of their parents or ancestors, then as a people who had by honest industry, and careful frugality, acquired a trifling fortune and therewith purchased that Small estate on which we then resided.
Our parents had been very careful in	;
the educating my Sister and me in the most polite manner. I had learnt Dancing, Music, and theuSual accomplishents for the cempleating a gentleman ; my Sister had likewiSe from them received many improvements which were not So easily acquired at School.
\Vhenever a relaxtion from my studies was requisite, Mustek gave me a relief,	^
and this I made my chief diversion.-------
But now a different Scene preSents.
■ My father having reSolved that Lucy.	f
should entirely leave the boarding School,	'
her education being compleated, and for ' i the future reside at home, he gave me orders to attend her in her return, and which orders I with PleaSure execut-	*
ed, as there was ever a very great mutual	,«
love Subsisting between us.
My sister on leaving the School took ai> affedionate farewell of a young lady, the
most
\
Mr. Charles Guildford. 13
most amiable I had ever Seen.-----1 was
preSent at this Scene. They appeared to have a very great friendship for each o- v ther, and their manner of parting greatly affedted me.—I must confeSs I was greatly pleaSed with this young beauty, and felt a peculiar yet pleasing fenSation I had not before experienced.
I at that moment wished mySelf Lucy, and envied her the tender embraces she received from her fair friend.
How delicate are the Sentiments and how exquisiiely fine the SenSations of that charming Sex! Their fouls are wholy formed for love and friendship. His in their breasts alone we must expect to find the Socialvirtuesin their greatestperfedtion.
We left the School without my learning this lady’s name but by the description I had formely received from my SiS-I	ter of miSs Charlotte Worthy, I fancied
it was she who was the objetst of my ad-I	miration.
I wished her mine, but ressedtion presented to ray view (if she was the lady I fuppoSed) too many insurmountable obstacles, ever to hope the completion ot my wishes. The moment we had parted from this young lady, I enquired her
name ^
I
i
14 M E M O I R S of
name of Lucy. Her anSwer confirm’d me in my opinion, and I had now no rea-Son to hope that I Should ever call her	,
mine.	'f
Mr. Worthy had already refuSed Several offers from gentlemen of considerable fortunes, whoSe extradlion not being So ancient and honourable as his own. She being a younger Son of one of , , the greatest families in the kingdom, and extremely proud, of the honour of his family, his chief failing; he had for that reaSon refuSed to contra<5b an alliance with them. What proSpedt therefore had I of Succeeding, being deficient in both.
ReaSon didlated to me in the preSent caSe and adviSed me to banish the new born passion, but love was too powerful and I could not resist its pleaSing force.—-I Sighed-—I mufed.—ReaSoned, then sighed again, at the impossibility of ever iucceeding in my desires, yet still reSolv-ed to love. My good genius whiSpered hope, and I gladly cherished the delusive i phantom.
I made my dear Lucy the confident of my new-born passion, deSiring her assist-	c
ance, and diredlions how to adt.--------
She prudently adyiSed me to banish a
passion,
Mr. Charles Guildford. 15
passion from my breast, which might otherwise render me unhappy for life.
Advice came now too late; and I renewed my entreaties. Lucy confented to befriend me. So far as to give me an opportunity of feeing Charlotte when she returned from School, which she informed me would be in a very short time, adding, “ My dear Charles I pity you, and “ that pity ariSes from the very great '	.	“ improbability there is of your ever
“ Succeeding.
“I am Satisfied your designs are ho-“ nourable, therefore convinced of that, “ I will life my utmost endeavours to “ Serve you, but fear it will be to little “ purpoSe.”
MiSs Charlotte Soon after left the boarding School, and returned to her Father’s Seat where my Sister immediately I	visited her.
She returned the visit in a few days,
,	when I had the pleaSure of being intro-
duced to her.—We entered into conversation on indifferent Subjedls, which Soon became lively and full of Spirit.—I was greatly pleaSed with the wit of this young lady, which added to a charming and inexhaustible flow of Spirits which she poS-
Seffed,
i6 M E M O I R S of
feffed, rendered her the most amiable, and entertajning of her Sex.—Every moment discovered new beauties in this charming maid. In short Charlotte in the few hours she Spent that day with us entirely compleated her conquest.
As for my Self her preSence at that time gave me an additional stow of Spirits, ' which added greatly to the native gaiety of my temper, and she v:as So kind as to expreSs herSelf pleaSed with the brother of her friend.
1 in justice confessed it was her agreeable company inSpired me with that happy disposition of temper, in which I then was.—She looked on this as a compliment, and as Such made a lively reply to it.
' During this happy converSe the moments passed unperceived, and time with	!
his feathered pinions fled Swiftly on.--	j,
Hill the approaching evening gave us	;
notice it was time to Separate. See my friend what an effedt love had on a young unexperienced man.—Butstis proper for the preSent, to bid you adieu, therefore	^

LETTER III.
After the visit I mentioned in my last, I had often the pleaSure of Seeing the agreeable miSs Worthy. As the brother of a friend, she always gave me a favourable reception, but I durst not as yet appear in the charafter of a lover.
I in the mean time purSued my studies with the greatest assiduity.
I had been adviSed by my father and my worthy friend Mr. Brown, to travel in order to study the works of the most famous masters, in ArchitefSure and Painting, efpecially thoSe of Italy and P>ance.
I was not leSs desirous of it before I had Seen Charlotte, but on the contrary had determined to leave England the moment I should be properly qualified for travel-’ ling for the purpoSe I mentioned, with which determination my friends were well acquainted. It was otherwiSe now, the face of things was entirely changed, love that powerful deity had extinguished thoSe desires. Honor, Fame, and Riches, nor even the view of distant countries, and
a prof-
i8 MEMOIRS of
a proSpeft of all thoSe master-pieces of art with which Italy and France abound, and	''
from a view of which I had formerly	'
fiattered mySelf I should receive the	I
greatest pleaSure, had not now any temp-	:
rations for me, strong enough to draw me forth from my blessed retirement. But my honor was engaged for the perfor-	i
mance of the promife I had made, to	|
travel and render mySelf, if possible, an accomplished architecst and painter ; it had iikewiie been my earnest request; besides my future welfare in Some Sort depended upon it.
The thoughts of this at first gave me very great uneafineSs ; but when I refiedt-ed, that a Separation from Charlotte on Such an occasion, was absolutely necessary in order to compleat my chief design ; I was much easier, and with tolerable patience expedted the destined moment, when I was to leave my native country.
Lucy had long been desirous of going to Bath. My father had lately had a very handSome legacy left him, the chief part of which, as he told me, was designed for my travelling expences.	^
As my father was now able to Supply us with Sufficient, to make a genteel appearance
I

pearance at the Bath, he was willing to gratify my Sisters inclinations, as he did not desire to deprive either of us of any innocent pleaSures, and thinking it might likewise be of Service to me, desired I would eScort her thither, and Spend Some time there during the SeaSon which was then approaching.	^
He told me I Snould there See an epitome, of the Great World, and stwould be of Service to us having as yet Seen but little company, and must therefore consequently be unacquained with many Scenes of real life, in which I might probably be afterwards more converSant.
He farther added, as I intended to travel, "twas highly necessary I should fee Something of my native country before I left it, and study the manners of the English, particularly in high life and not to go into foreign countries, and obServe their arts, manners, customs, &c. of other nations, and be at the Same time intirely ignorant of thofe of my own.
I readily complied with my father’s request, and the more fo as Charlotte was ! • to pay a visit to lord Worthy, a near relation, who was foon expedted down at his feat at L * * * * * about fifty miles
distant
20 M E M O I R S of
distant from our village, v/here my Sister informed me, stwas SuppoSed miSs Worthy would Spend a great part of the Summer SeaSon.
I was therefore very well pleaSed with the propoSal my father had made, as knowing I should Spend my time in a ivery diSagreeable manner at home, dur-	'
ing the abSence of that young lady.	!
Soon after miSs Worthy Set out for his lordships Seat, accompanied by her parents So that I could not have the pleaSure of attending her any part of the way.
The country which till then was always pleaSant and agreeable to me, now be-f came dull and insipid.—The Scene that was formerly So delightful had now lost its power of charming, and was not any longer agreeable to me.
I had never confided my Secret to any '	but my sister; and now miSs Worthy was
gone, I feared my behaviour might give my parents or Some other a SuSpicion, and they might thereby make a diScovery of what I was fiesirous of cpncealisig I therefore reminded Lucy of our intended	,
journey, who as impatiently waited for the moment of our departure as myfelf.
The
!	Mr. Charles Guildford. 21
The generous girl told me she was not inSenSible of the uneaSineSs, the abSence I	of her friend gave me ; and that vv^ere it
'	on no other account she should hasten our
departure as Soon as she could. y	Lucy took an opportunity of renewing
I	her request to my father, and he imme-
diately gave orders for the necessary preparations to be made for our journey.
We had among our domestics one John Trueman who had lived in our family for Some years. He was ordered to attend us to Bath : but it is impossible to exprefs the joy of the poor grateful fellow, at the news that he was to attend us; for he had always professed a very great regard and esteem for me, and I really believe he loved me sincerely.
Every thing being ready for our departure, we fet out in the stage coach, and Trueman accompanied us on horfeback. But should I proceed any further it would be making this letter too long, therefore I must defer giving you an account of our journey, and the company we had with us in the stage, till the next.
Yours, See.

LET-

■ f
IM U S T now give you Some account of our journey. We had averyplea-Sant one. Our company were agreeable and diverting. There were four besides Lucy and mySelf; viz. a fat gentleman in black, who by his appearance Seemed	jf
to be a divine Sat on one fide of me,	r
and on the other hand Sat a military gen-	*
tleman. Opposite to the minister Sat a fat, corpulent, roSy cheeked lady, who Seemed to be about thirty ; her appearance was that of a rich widow, but she looked rather of the low kind, than a gentlewoman of birth and fortune. My sister Sat opposite to me, and on her right hand Sat a prim, demure young lady who Seldom lifted up her eyes, unleSs to take a private glance at the gentleman in red, who Soon informed us that he bore the commission of a Captain.	<	,
I remained silent, in order to make observations on my fellow travellers. I believe my sister’s intentions were^the fame.
. The captain at first diverted us by paying his addresses, in Some pretty loud
whiSpers
Mr, Charles Guildford. '23
whiSpers to miSs Prim, and made pretty free with her ladyship’s hand, which she very cautioussy often withdrew for fear of defilement, at the Same time giving him many Significant looks, visible to the
I whole company, and which Seemed to proceed from an angry heart, but a few private glances she gave him when she SuppoSed herSelf unobServed by the rest of the company, carried with them a more favourable appearance.
I carefully obServed my companions, and there was Scarce a Single look eScaped me. I guessed I should make a tolerable phyfiogmonist, and experience confirmed me in my opinion.
The gentleman in black Soon informed us what he was, and gave us a significant hint, that he was poffeffed of a pretty good living ; as I guessed by his bulk and the quantity of flesh v/ith which he was cloathed, and which Seemed to be pretty firmly fixed upon his bones: in short he was not a Skeleton. The fat lady for a large quantity of Solid ssessi and well cloath’d ribs, if possible exceeded the divine.
The parfon and her ladyship entered into diScourSe together, and we Soon learnt
hat
24 M E M O I R S of -
that madam was a widow, had Saved a pretty large fortune by trade, which was increased by Some legacies her friends had left her, and that she had no children.
The man of God brightened up prodi-gioufiy at this diScourSe. He Said he was a widower, and, like'" the gentlewoman, was not troubled with any children, for which he was very thankful. As his diScourSe did not then Seem to be diredled to any one in particular, I opened my lips, to ash him his reaSon, if he had Sufficient to Support them. “ Why really,” fays the parSon, “ they are very trouble-“ Some, and very expensive ; for though “ I have a tolerable living, of between “ three and four hundred a year, yet you “ know, sir, that is but little for a man “ that has been bred a gentleman, to live “ upon. I canst bear fatigue and trou-“ ble; it overcomes me, having never “ been uSed to it. I am obliged to give a curate above thirty pounds a year,
“ only to officiate for me in the week “ days, and of a Sunday morning; for \ “ I commonly preach myfelf on a Sab-“ bath, in the evening; but it is very fa-“ tiguing, and very troubleSome; to Speak
“ So
I
Mr. Charles Guildford. 2^
“ So loud, and for near half an hour to-“ gether, without ceasing.”
“ I have time however by means of my “ curate ; to Spend a few hours with Some “ worthy friends in my parish. There is “ Squire Dull, and Squire Cobb ; and Se-“ veral other gentlemen, who are charm-“ ing companions. We live as happy as “ can be expected, or even desired; for “ they insist on having me out almost eve-“ ry day, a fox hunting, coursing, or chal-“ or fishing, or shooting, or Some Coun-try diversion, and I can’t deny them ; “ and if I don’t go out with them or visit, “ them, they will come and drink a bottle “ and Smoke a pipe along with me at home. I have rare odtober sir, in my “ cellar and they like it extremely well. “ So we Spend our time merrily enough, in Summer with our country Sports; and “ in winter we do not want for diversions, “ but added the parSon I want a gooei careful houSe keeper,” giving the widow a very insignificant look.
“ I life exerciSe, in order to reduce my “ size a little; but you See,” putting his hand to his stomach, in a jocoSe manner, and laughing heartily, “ I can’t bring “ down my fat.” To this I Said, I SuppoSc sir, VoL. I.	C	stis
f
26 M E M O I R S of
“ *tis for exerciSe you are now go-“ ing to Rath. That is one ReaSon.” Says , he, “ butto tell you the truth,” whiSpering	I
in my ear, (but loud enough to be heard	i
by the vshole company,) his to See if “ I can’t drop into a pretty comfortable “living, that is at last become vacant;
“ and which I have long been in Expec-tation of. The patron is now at Bath,
“ and I am going to pay him a visit, hav-“ ing Some interest with Him.”
d'hough I had heard much of marikind, and read more ; yet I must confeSs I was Surprised at this reverend gentleman’s diS-' courSe : however I concealed it from the observation of my fellow travellers, that they might not think I was entirely ignorant of the world.
The Divine having given us this laudable account of himSelf, employed his whole time in ogling the widow, whore-turned his lovely glances in the most endearing manner; but he Seemed anxious to know the extent of the lady’s fortune ; notwithstanding her own Spe-cefick gravity; was Sufficient for any reasonable man ; yet the parSon wanted an addition of a more precious Substance, to render it still more agreeable.
There
\
Mr. Charles Guildford. 27
Hiere was nothing but this dreadful uncertainty preserved the parSons heart.
No Sooner had the Widow hinted that it extended to Some thouSands; than she compleated her conquest, as was plainly evident. Soul and Body was now entirely devoted to her ladyship’s Service, Her beauty and the majesty and grace-fulneSs of her perSon; were his darling' theme. Several fine, common placed compliments, the reverend gentleman 'paid his new mistreSs on her Beauty, and at length in a whiSper, confessed the power of her cha’-ms.
The widow was moved, pretended to blush and appeared in a dilemma how to adfc. ’Twas evident that her ladyship I	was as nearly touched with Cupid’s dart,
as her lover.
In the whole, I judged there was one match almost concluded.
Each had near exhausted their mao-a-zine, and repetition must necessarily ea-Sue ; therefore -J fixed my observation,
,	more particularly, on .the officer and his
favourite.
The Captain was staring at the blushing lovely, coy, (demure maid, who often C 2	preten(ding
4	N
28 M E M O I R S of
dretending to hide her face from his Saucy : n 1 uncontrouled eyes; took thoSe opportunities of ogling her admirer through the Separations which she made between	^
her fingers and which I imagine she thought she couldSafely do without dangerof being discovered by the rest of the company.
The captain after a full gaze would cry in raptures, “ Demme madam you are “very handSome; You are extremely “ pretty ! You have made a conquest and “ I am your everlasting stave. ’ And then Seizing her hand would lift it to his lips with alL.the eagerneSs of an enraptured lover, when she would affedledly cry; “ Lard sir, I beg sir, pray sir,’*
Whilst the man militant with a lively warmth pressed her fair hand, which she would faintly attempt to withdraw.
You will perhaps aSk me, if there were not Some civil things Said to Lucy, or if we held no difcourSe with our fellow travellers ? both sir! tho’ as to Lucy, she regarded not what was Said to her, and I was too much employed in making observations, to Spend much time in conversation.
I am afraid I have been already too tedious, but will attone for it by my future
brevity.

Mr. Charles Guildford. 29
brevity. I shall only acquaint you with the reSult of the courtships I mentioned, and then proceed to more interesting Subjects.
The Captain before our journey wa« ended, made a declaration of love, in form to his fair charmer. As I was afterwards informed, the lover wanted her to Surrender upon honourable terms, as. he called it, without the Sanction of the church. MiSs did not at first approve of that; but finding the captain reSolutely bent on living a Single life, she at length thought proper to Surrender on his terms.
It was her first tranSgression of that kind, and she was Sufficiently puniSned for it. After he had possessed her, he was cloyed, growing cool, she upbraided him.
He did not like upbraidings and therefore, abandoned her to shame and milery. She had a Small fortune, though not equivalent to the captain’s; and as he found, he could purchaSe her on eafier terms than marriage, ’tis not to be SuppoSed, that a	1
man of bad morals, (for Such he really was) would aCt in an honourable manner.
If nature, time, place; hot blood, and high Spirits, assist the designing lover C 3	with
30 M E M O I R S of
with his perSwaSive eloquence, to rouze the raging passions, which were before in embryo, and every thing, even opportu-	\
nity joining with his wishes, contributes to, and confpircs the fair one’s overthrow; where is the triumph? or whole is the glory ? But ressedtions aside, let us now return to the parSon and his lady.	, ■
ishe Divine as became his cloth ; had the fear of God before his eyes, which added to this consideration, that the widow was possessed of fix or Seven thouSand pounds, induced him to make her an offer of his hand and heart, according to the ancient lawful form. The widow gladly accepted the valuable prefent, and the loving pair where foon after married.
But how was the reverend gentleman mistaken when he hugged himSelf for his ad-dreSs, in gaining a handfome widow with Such a fortune! On enquiring of his • SpouSe how she had diSpoSed of her money and if she had Secured it, she told him it was Secure enough, for it was all her last hushands asserts, and that she as administratrix was then in possession of them.—
‘‘ That’s right,” Says the ParSon interrupt-; ■	■ ing
I
Mr. Charles Guildford. 31
ing her, “ but, reSumes SpouSe, there “ are debts to she full amount, or rather “ more, and thoSe effedb, are bound “ with the payment of them ; and they “ must be paid Soon, unleSs you had ra-“ ther be obliged to it by law.”
The hushand stood motionLTs. At length a deep groan issued, and down he dropt, the good vrife applied her Salts with SucceSs, and gave him immediate relief. He confessed her kindneSs, Said stwas then too late to repent, and there-. fore he might as well make himSelf eaSy, for if he had not money enough, he had wife enough.' All his hopes were that he Sliould make amends for this foolish step, by getting possession of the expedled living.
He Succeeded in that, and now his two livings, in the whole, brought him in near Seven hundred pounds per annum.
The ParSon for I afterwards Saw him, . Sometimes Said he was pretty well contented, only a wife without a fortune vexed him.
He Seemed to hint, could he but make his income an even thouSand he should be very well Satisfied ; but added, “ I must C 4	“ make

“ make mySelf eaSy, diSpenSations and “ changes are not eaSy to procure.”

Sincere friend,

LETTER V.
IF any of my former epistles have been agreeable to you, I hope this will prove no leSs entertaining.
On our arrival at the Bath having Settled ourSelves in genteel lodgings, and taken Some refreshments, we begged the • favour of our landlady’s company. Her name was Talkative.
We inquired of her, the news of the place, and what other lodgers she had.
She anSwered fully to all our questions, and when we had once moved the Spring of her tongue, stwas with difficulty we stopped it.
She gave us a general history of Scandal, an account of the chief company .then at the Bath, in which were included many long descriptions, of their perSons, fortunes, and equipages, together with an account of the amours, and intrigues of the chief personages there. ’.Ds need-lefs to be more particular.
In regard to her lodgers, she inform.ed us, she had only one; that a genlteman, who by his apppearance she judged to be I	of considerable fortune. That fiie be-

sieved he was a man of good fenSe ; Seemed to be very generous ; was very good natured and agreeable, as far as she had Seen of him but that he had not been long at Bath.	^
We enquired his name. She Said it ’twas Honor, we then begged her to in-itroduce us to his acquaintance. She gave us her promiSp. Mr. Honor early the next morning paid us a visit, welcomed us to Bath in the most polite and genteel > , manner, readily accepted of our invitation to breakfast with us, and I Soon perceived that he fully anSwered the cha-radler Mrs 'Talkative had given of him.
He was handSome, genteel, free and eaSy, his wit lively, his judgment Solid and penetrating ; in short he was made to charm, and the most agreeable companion I have ever met with.
He Said he understood we were strangers ; and that, he was almost So himSelf; being but lately come there, after making the Tour of Europe : but that he was very intimate, with one Sir John Philips, a man who had contraDed a very large and extensive acquaintance in the Beau Monde : and that by his means he could
introduce
/
Mr. Charles Guildford. 35
introduce us, into a genteel acquaintance during our’reSidence phere.
He frankly confessed, that he was very much prejudiced in our favour, and that whatever Service was in his pow’^er to perform for us he hoped we should be So free as to make uSe of him, and without farther ceremony inroll him in the number of our friends: we returned him thanks for his offers, eSpecially thofe of his friendship. He desired we would permit him to accompany us that morning, to the Long Room. We thanked him and readily conSented. He begged us to , be more free and behave as if we had been long acquainted. I promiSed him I would, my sister curteSyed in silent assent, and we Separated to dreSs,
Just as I was dressed, Mr. Honor introduced a gentleman, whom he presented to me as his friend, Sir John Phillips. He was a lively, gay young fellow.
Upon entering into conversation wdth him.
I found that he was possessed of a very extensive knowledge of the v/orld, had a	^
great share of good SenSe and wit, but his wit was inclined to Satire.
He could not avoid giving us Several C 6	.	Sa.tyrical
\ /
S 6	M E M O I R S of
Satyrical charaDers of Some of his acquaintance, before he introduced us to them.
“ There is my lord Courtly,” Says he “ a nobleman, of a very genteel fortune, “ has a place at court, and great interest, “ for that reaSon his friendship is much “ courted, he is a very civil polite gentle-“ man, will embrace yon, fold you in “ his arms, offer you his friendship, and beg to be reckoned in the number of “ your friends: himSelf, his Sword, his fortune are all at your Service, and you •	may command them whenever you
“ pleale.”
“ TheSe are all momentary ; for if any “ one depends upon his word, they are “ certain of a disappointment In short “ one Single thread, from the webb of a Spider, will weigh down ten thoufand “ of his promises.
.	‘ You canst help fatyrizing your friends,
“ Jack,” Says Mr Honor.
I anSwered, “ I hope there is no one “ that really deServes the charadler. Sir “ John has given us.
“ I am afraid you’H find it too true,” Mr. Honor replied.
“ 1 am really Surprised at it,” Says I, “ for to me it appears very ridiculous,
“ that
!
Mr. Charles Guildford. 37
“ that a man should be lavish in his of-“ fers of friendship or Service to a man “ and yet never intend to perform any of “ thoSc promises he So liberally makes.
“ He must appear deSpicable to every “ one that knows his real charaDer, and “ to himSelf likewiSe; if he would but “ paSs an impartial and Strid examination “ on his own adions.
“ He is what we call a great man,’*
ISays Sir John, many court his favour,
“ and endeavour to cultivate a friendship “ with him for their own private interest,
“ though at the Same time whilst they are “ flattering him with their tongues, they “ deSpiSe him in their hearts.
“ And that he justly deServes I replied; “ and his flatterers at the Same time meet “ with a proper return.’*
The entrance of a friend has interrupt-cd me, therefore at preSent, adieu.
Yours, &c.
Charles Guildford.

NOW I shall proceed again to Sir
John’s charadlen	?
After we had made Several moral re-fiedfions on lord Courtly’s charadter. Sir John adds, “ There is Dick Rover a “ young fellow of fortune, who is reSolv’d “ to Spend it in dreSs, and entertainifients “ for the ladies. He is what they call a “ genteel lover. The first lady he meets • ' “ with a fair face, he protests he loves her, “declares a violent passion; Swears e-“ ternal constancy ; Sometimes tho’ per-	||
“ haps very Seldom, he compleats an	'
“ intrigue; and then goes to another.
“To her he vows, she has charmed his “ roving Soul to constancy; and fixed it “ eternally hers. Intrigues or breaks off “ and then to another; and is constant to “ each till either SucceSs has crowned his “ hopes and possession cloyed his desires, or “ that there are no longer any hopes of “ SucceSs.
“ I have known him”--------prithee for
“ shame Jack desist,” Says Mr. Honor in-• terruping him, “ and don’t treat thy ac-	j
“ quaintance thus.” I am only describing them,” Says Sir John, proceeding, “ I .	“ have
' /
Mr. Charles Guildford. gg
“ have known him have no leSs than five “ different appointments depending at one “ time; when it has required his utmost “ shill, to manage prudently; So as to “ prevent a diScovery from either quarter,
“ and a diSpoSal of them in a proper man-“ ner, that he might not exhaust too great “ a quantity of his Spirits, I have not pati-“ ence to hear you out,” thou eternal Sa-tyrist Says Mr. Honor.
“ I have done,” anSwered Sir John,
“ only I must acquaint Mr. Guildford “ with the charadter of miSs Simper. She is a young lady that is always Smiling,
“ gay and chearful. So chearful that she “ is continually laughing, but it is at no-“ thing ; and makes me doubt the Sound-“ neSs of her intellects, I believe in real-“ ity she is little better than an ideot.
“ Then there’s.”------Well,” Says Mr.
Honor interrupting him again, “ I have “ done,” Says Sir John, “ only you will “ observe miSs Flutter, if you should “ chance to Say a civil thing to her, En-“ passant, she is all on fire, all in confu-“ Sion ; her blushes appear; her boSom “ riSes and falls, in the most pretty and “ artleSs manner, at least it Seems So to ' “ thoSe who know her not, her hands

tremble, her pulfe beats quick, and “she is in very great disorder, and all “ this for fear you should desist from “ whiSpering civil things, and pay thoSe “ compliments she thinks her due to Souie “ other beauty
Have you done now ?” Says Mr. Honor, “ Yes,” Says Sir John I have, becauSe “ you are impatient, only, for God’s Sake “ dont proceed any farther,” Mr. Honor “ Said interrupting him, “ I did not isi-“ tend it,” returns Sir John laughing,
“ but ymu are frightened at nothing, for “ what I intended to Say was, that its	i
“ proper to give Mr. Guildford Some in-	'
“ fight into the characters of thoSe, to “ whoSe acquaintance I would introduce “ him ; that he might not be deceived “ by falSe appearances; but you will not “ permit me to give him a tenth part of “ the chafadters, you know I could easily	'
“ do.” I know Says Mr. Honor, “ you “ can if you pleaSe give my friend many “ pretty characters, and SuppoSe you will	'
“ make uSe of the first opportunity my “ abSence gives you, to make him ac-“ quainted with mine. “ That I will,”
Sir John replied, and it shall be a pretty one too. “ I don’t doubt it in the least,”
lays
Mr. Charles Guildford. 41
Says Mr. Honor, my Sister coming down at this instant interrupted the conversation, and it took another turn.
Lucy when she came down, was laughing. After Sir John had paid his compliments to her, I aSked her the occasion of b her mirth; she Said the floors were rubbed So Smooth that she did little elSe but ,	Aide from one place to another when she
stirred. So that by the time we left Bath she should learn to Ske^t.
We could not help laughing at her fancy. Sir John paid her the compliment of being a fine lady, and that I must certainly be extremely happy in the company and conversation of So amiable a sister. We returned his compliment, and though I received it as Such, yet I must confeSs Lucy that day appeared formed for conquest:.
Her eyes Sparkled with joy, and the thoughts of her approaching pleaSure in making her appearance in the long room, had cast a glow upon her cheeks, which added to an agreeable Smile, and a pretty Serene eaSy countenance, made her appear lovely,
I plainly perceived that Mr. Honor observed her with a peculiar pleaSure,
and
42 M E M O I R S of	'
and Seemed charmed v/ith her appearance, her lively v/it and agreeable humour. In	j
Sliort, I did not doubt but Lucy had	''
gained a conquest before she had made	|
her appearance in the long room. As tve were v»^aiking along Mr. Honor Said to mo, “ My friend Sir John is fond	j
“ of Satire, rather too fond of it; yet I “ must confeSs there is I think too much “ reaSon for him to exerciSe his fiivourite “ talent.
“ The morals and manners of man-“ kind are now growm So vicious, and “ vice is So much the mode, and Such “ countenance given to it in the Beau	\
‘‘Monde; that its a moral impossibility	■;
“ for a man that’s not endowed with an “ uncommon share of prudence and dif-“ cretion^^ to eScape free and untainted ;

“ A man ought to be continually upon “ his guard, againft thoSe prevailing vices “ that are now So much in vogue, and to “ keep the strictest guard over his passions “ for fear the insinuating, infedbing j‘ “ venom, should corrupt his morals, and 1 “ destroy his principles.

LETTER VII.
IH O P E you are too wtII acquainted with my Sincerity to believe I would ever attempt to impeSe a falshood upon your understanding; and this conSiderati-on, joined to my knovriedge of your being well acquainted with the world, induces me to think, Twill be no great dish-culty to gain your belief to what I write. Therefore without farther ceremony I shall affure you, that by the best observations I could make, on thoSe to whom Sir John introduced me, not only on my first acquaintance with them, but at other j ^	times when in their company, and con-
I	verfing with the n; I found the description
!	he had given me, of lord Courtly, Dick
Rover, MiSs Simper, MiSs Flutter and many others, to be exadly true.
A vast medley of different charadters; a great number of different people ; of almost all ranks and denominations,
I	there daily preSent themSelves to view. In
short an epitome of the world in general, may be found at Bath.
Nothing but being an eye witneSs to I ^ many things I then Saw, and have eften
since
46	MEMOIRS of	I
since Seen with almost equal wonder, could have convinced me, that there were Such people in the world; or that there were Such things done, as I there Saw. But	|
my dear friend. I have since learnt not to	j
wonder at any thing, that is in the power	I
of man to perform.	> I
My friends and my books, had often	!
informed me of flatterers, knaves, fools,	j
coxcombs, fops &c. but I always thought	/
with proper deference to my kind informers ; that for my good, they Spoke rather too cenSorioufly, of mankind; for I did not think that stwas possible for human nature, ever to be So far vitiated, as I have often since by experience found it is.
Friends and acquaintance, are now Sy-nonimous terms. But there are few who are acquainted with the infinite pleaSure ariSing from real friendship. ‘
Is it not shocking in the highest degree to hear a man with the most Solemn aflev-erations, promiSe thoSe things with his .	*
mouth, which are as far distant from his heart, and from his thoughts of performing them; as heaven from earth!
This was what I afterwards experienced, in my acquaintance with lord Courtly ^
tho’

though I never trusted to any promiSe he made me: but this was rather owing to the charadter I had heard of him, from Sir John Philips than to my own jndgement;	,
otherwise I doubt, I should have been deceived by thoSe fair and Specious marks of a worthy generous man; as many before had been.
Dick Rover entirely anSwered the cha-radler Sir John had given him, for I have often been an eye witneSs of the addresses he has paid to* feveral ladies of distinguished beauty, wit, and fortune; and which were Severally made with all the fervor and ardency a real passion could inlpire.
MiSs Simper as Sir John faid, was continually laughing at the Jest of every fop, and the falSe wit of every coxcomb plea-fed her, she was often laughed at; and almost as often joined in the laugh against herSelf, which would add to the mirth of the company and consequently to hers; when she did not perceive that it was at her expence, her acquaintance diverted themSelves. When site at any time SuS-peded the truth, she then joined the general chorus, to hide her concern and confusion, from the observation of the company.

MiSs Flutter’s charaDer had been as well delienated by Sir John’s. Her anxiety was often preceptible, and all her art was insufficient, to hide her concern from ^ a judicious eye. '	-	-	*
There were many coquets, that had a	^
large share of vanity; almost as many prudes with a great share of hypocriSy *, a	'
' very great number of Fine Ladies, who wanted for neither beauty, nor wit; yeti believe poffeffed but a Small share of modesty, or good nature; though I am certain there were Several that were truly amiable and poffeffed every Social virtue.	‘
My Sister being a new comer, beaus and 1 fops, (though I make a distinction, I believe it’s only nominal; for there is little essential difference between them;) buzz’d about her, and many professed themSelves her admirers.
Lucy had been too well bred, to give . . affront to any one, that did not designedly S: offer any to her; yet she in a pretty genteel manner, diiengaged herSelf from them, and Sir John Philips, and Mr. Honor; were the chief of her acquaintance, amongst the gentlemen during our residence at Bath.

Mr. Honor behaved to us with the 'greatest politencSs, his compliments in in general were far more particular to Lucy than to any other ladies of his acquain-tOice.
• I observed it, but did not take any no-' tice of it to either ot' them.
As Mr. Honor Seemed to me, to be an honest worthy, generous man; and as Such, would Scorn to be guilty of a mean aisiion, I entertained a very great esteem for him, and thought myfelf honoured in , the friendship of a man So greatly my Superior in fortune, merit, and every accomplishment both natural-and acquired.
He had read the most valuable authors, had travelled Sor improvement, and had Seen and been converSant in Several for-eigh courts from whestce he had acquired a very great share of politehefs and good breeding. He had a natural eloquence, which added to a vast fund of knowledge both of men and books; rendered him -a very agreeable and instrudlive acquaintance. He was well made, and poffeSSed of an uncommon share of manly (not ef-*	feminate beauty, and of every necessary
accomplishment, to complcat -the Real fine gentleman.

No wonder you will Say, if he engaged the particular attention of the fair lex.
I v/as Several times paid the compliment of being like this worthy man ; but I will assure you, I had not the vanity to -believe thoSe that attempted to impoSc upon me, in Such a palpable manner.
’Tis pity that there is not, a Severe pu-	|

We often enjoyed the pleaSure of Mr.

“ did not intend it as a jest; but I mean “ they are not all equal to that young lady,

I anSwered, “I am obliged toyoti my “ dear Lucy : you now Speak the lan'-guage of m.y heart.” I vras proceeding, when she interrupted me, by desiring my ^	- opinion of the place, the company we had
Seen, and the rnerit of our acquaintance,^ ■and I freely gave her my Sentiments on the chief part, but excepted Sir John, and Mr. Honor, leaving that part for Lucy to expatiate on.
She owned her Surprize at wshat she had Seen, since her afrival at that city; v/as equal or rather Superior, to wshat I had confessed, on the recital of Sir John’s in- ' strudtions, before our appearance in the long room ; and which she had not at first 'had an opportunity of hearing; therefore was very much unprepared for the Scenes tliat enlued.
She wondered I had not mentioned Sir John and Mr. Honor; and Said, she eS--teemed them both, as men of very great D 2	merits

I could not but aprove of it, in regard to the worthiness of the objedl. MyesteerU for him daily encreaSed, and the more I conversed with, and knew him, the grea*' ter was my wonder and Surprize.
He entertained a very great regard for me, and we contraDed the stridtest friendship. The friendship of two brothers born in the Same moment, and from their infancy bred up together ; could not be more strict nor could we be dearer to each other.
With what infinite pleaSure, did that dear man perform any kind office for me, and how would he rejoice at any opportunity that offered to do me Service.

How many agreeable, and contented families, Ov/e that happy Serenity, and eaSy situation in life they now enjoy to his generosity!
1	hope you will not think me partial;,
but this is a theme, on which I could for ever dwell.	'	-
Gaming, you know, makes a principal part in the diverfions at Bath. A vice* which though alv-ays very predominant: there ; is now, I think, if possible, more So.
My friend cautioned mie against having too at a fondneSs for that curSed diversion; and made many moral and just resiedlions" thereon; the truth of which were Soon verified, in Several instances, of the folly' of thoSe,... who purSued it with too great

There was one WilSon, (I think thar ■was his name,) who made a very genteel! '	* appearance, and was esteemed as a man
of birth, and fortune; but whom I have jeaSon to believe was nothing but a common sharper or gambler. He kept gen^ teel company. Spent money liberally, and' ingratiated hi.mSelf into the favour of Several sine ladies, and of Several noblemen and gentlemen of fortune; but there were few of his acquaintance but what it was in., general thought, paid dear for his friendship in Some shape or other.
* He carried off from Bath in a Small, time, a pretty large Sum; that chiefiy from the gentlemen ; and Some ladies were SuSpedtest to have got, others lost more by him, than any or them-deSired.
Is it not my dear friend, very Surprising that gentlemen of family and fortune who have been liberally educated, and' commonly esteemed men of judgment, and a delicate taste; can be So far infatuated, as to contrast a friendst.ip, at least a pretty stristintimacy withi common sharpers, whom they meet with at a gaming table?

’Tis far beneath the dignity of a man, that is him Self possessed, of any the least fiiare of merit; to keep company with Such vile miScreants.
For a gentleman to hazard his fortune, by affociadng and gaming with Such';, proves him a votary of the goddeSs Folly.
Flow many amiable vrives, lovely children, and happy families; have been rendered miserable by that vice.

LETTER, IX.
IT H I N K my last was chiefly em--ployed in encomiums on my friend Mr. Honor, and concluded with Some, (pc'i'haps to you,) . unnecessary refledli-ons on the detestable, vice of gaming.
I	I would not v/iilingly be tedious, but
I	will endeavour to be as brief as possible,
j - I believe this epistle will be a Specimen of my promised brevity.
Mr. Honor, after we had been Sometime at Bath, declared himSelf my sisters ivimirer, and begaed permission to pay Ills addreffes to her parents for their consent, to make him happy.
Lucy acquainted me with Mr. Honor’s' eieclnration, and the propoSals he had made the first opportunity she had confessed that
the was not diStgrreable to her; and farther added that if her parents, and' her dear brother, had not any objedlion ;• she could approve of him as a companion for life.

having before assured him, that she hadi not, nor did expedl any fortune, at least-worth mentioning.
His^ generous Soul Seemed to re;_joice at this discovery, and convinced her that his views were not in the least mercenary, or his designs Sordid and baSe; be coufeffed himSelf excessively pleaSed at her generous frankneSs,
Mr. Honor Soon after mentioned it to ^
.me; and told me, though he had given, me Several hints, which he balieved 1 had not observed; that he had a very great regard for my sister, yet he did not chuSe to explain him.Self, until he had declared his Sentiments to the perSon most concerned, and if she approved his addresses, he then determined to try for the Sanction of her friends approbation, hoping Ij would give my conSent, and be his advocate as he assured me his future happi-	I
nefs depended on his SucceSs..	,
I again mentioned to him how trifling Lucy’s fortune was. He affured me that his own was Sufficient, and that he did not	'
require any addition to it by marriage.	i
That this was a circumstance which far	'
from giving him any uncaSineSs, afforded him the greatest pleaSure, as it would coiir

vihce me his regard was sincere and unbiassed by any interested views. He then pressed me in the most urgent manner, to uSe my endeavours to bring, the affair to a happy and Speedy conclusion.
I told him we should Soon return to----
and that then I would endeavour to gain my parent’s conSent, and assureddiim that when they were Satisfied of his charafter and that stwas agreeable to Lucy’s inclinations, they would readily comply with-, his request.
My parents in this reSpedf and in many others, were of, a very different taste, to the generality, of the moderns; who I find have lately obtained an a6l to prevent clandestine marriages, which gives a pa-* rent, or the relations of a young lady a very^extenSive power, over her. A power I believe more extensive than nature ever designed to entrust into the hands of-any one.

WE had a very pleaSant journey, and were greatly entertained with, the diverting yet improving conversation of Lucy’s admirer. My Sister and I . were joyfully welcomed home, by our kind and affedlionate,parents. I preSented my friend to, them, and they gave him a very friendly, polite reception.
Mr. Honor the first opportunity, renewed his propoSals; and begged my father’s conSemt; who confeffeel his only objedlion was, Lucy’s fortune, which he did not think was in the least ec^uivalent
to
Mr. Charles Guildford. 65
to what a man of his merit, exclusive of his own fortune might justly expe6lT. That as that objedtion w'as too great to-be removed, he hoped Mr. Honor would excuSe him if he could not comply. My friend, at this-, was struck dumb with astonishment. My father left.him to give him an opportunity of recovering himSelf,’ from the Surprize, his diScourSe had threw him into.
Mr. Honor made uSe of this opportunity, to find me. DeSpair was paintr-ed in his countenance, and with visible.* emotion, he told me that my father had. refuSed his conSent. I started, pauSed;, then begged him to-relate the conversation that had passed between them. He did, and this revived me; as I knew my friend’s happineSs depended on the SucceSs. of his preSent designs. I determined to. uSe the influence I had, and did not doubt of fucceSs. I assured him my father’s rea-Son was only owing to a reludlance, in giving my Sister in marriage to a man of hisfortuneand merit; without.an adequate fortune, that generossty and So.me pride I‘ durst Say were his only motives and that he had not any other cauSe for refusing his confent.
Mr
66 M E M O I R S of
Mr. Honor begged if that was really all the objedtion, his happineSs might be no longer delayed; but that I would intercede for my father’s donSent, as fortune was what he did not in the least desire, with a young lady of my sister’s merit, nor did he want it, and farther that he could not be happy without her. He . told me he had a father living, of whoSe conSent he was fully assured, it always having been a rule with him for any man, especially his own Son, who had a fortune Sufficient to Support himSelf and a wife, according to his birth, not to require fortune, but merit with a woman.
He farther informed me he had large expedtations on his father’s death, which was a period he should not ever wish for, was he thereby to become possessed of the Indian world, as he had been the moss:..	;
kind and indulgent parent, and that had	"l
he been otherwise, his Sentiments in that reSpedt would have been the Same. I promised him my assistance, and gave him hopes that my intercession would not be in vain.
I applied, according to my promiSe, to my father, and to my ever kind mother who was preSent when I made this appll-	,

cation. I affured them that my friend had a due SenSe of their honour; but that I was certain the happineSs of his future life depended upon their compliance, that he was a man of Solid judgment,,and well knew how to distinguish between beauty and merit; and that the latter ' was the prevailing charm in Lucy, that attracfled his esteem; that he had a handSome fortune, clear from incumbrances, and needed not the portion of a wife to make good the payment of any debts.
I farther added that he was affured of his father’s conSent, who was the honourable Thomas Honor, Efq; of Honor-hall in Yorkshire ; a gentleman of birth and fortune. My father Said he had heard of old Mr. Honor.	/
I proceeded,, made ufe of all the per-SuaSions I was master of, to gain his con-, Sent, and my mother’s; and affured them if I was not certain that a refuSal would be highly prejudicial to my friend, I would not urge it, as I was Sensible of the very great inequality of their fortunes..
My mother at length convinced by my reaSons joined with me, in my intercessi-i	ons, though she was before against it;
through the fame principle of honour.
My
M E M O I R S ' of
My father at length overcome with our joint importunities conSented on conditionr that Mr. Honor would obtain hisfather"s conSent, and farther would at any time af-	'
terwards, if it should be in my father’s power to give Lucy a fortune, accept of it.	'
I propoSed it to Mr. Honor, who, tho’	j
he did not want the conditions, y’-et glad-	[
ly embraced the opportunity of compleat-ing his wishes.
Mr Honor obtained his father’s conSent, and preparations being made; he Soon after eSpouSed my dear Lucy; He had before desired us immediately on the celebrating his nuptials' to repair to his own	,
feat, and that we would accompany him thither, to which we could not refufe our •conSent. I easily guessed the generous motive, but did not mention it. The ceremony over, we went to his Seat at ———	.
in Nottinghamshire; where I found there were preparations making for our reception.
Old Mr. Honor arrived Soon after, he shewed us particular marks of favour and reSpedl; and Seemed extremely wtH pleaSed with the choice his Son had made by what passed between.my lather and him,. I had
reaSon

reaSon to believe they had been formerly acquainted. We were entertained in the most agreeable manner.
The neighbouring poor enabled by the bounty of my worthy brother: gladly rejocied on the happy occasion.
Hsis neediefs to deScribe his fine Seat, pleaSant gardens, and the delightful situation of the whole ; or the particulars of the entertainment we met with. I shall only affure you that stwas in every reSpedt worthy of the man whom I could now call by the dear name of brother.
Lucy wished for the company of her friend MiSs Charlotte Worthy ; to have graced her Nuptials, and have been a witneSs to her happineSs ; but she was not ,as yet returned from Lord Worthy’s.
We Spent Sometime at Mr Honor’s-Seat in the most agreeable manner. Winter ' drawing on, and our parents being desirous of our returning home, Mr. Honor propoSed to Lucy ; Spending that Winter in London, to which she readily consented, but begged to See her friend Charlotte first, whom she had acquainted of her marriage; and who had in anSwer Sent her a letter of congratulation upon the happy occasion.

to procure me a private audience as Ibon possible; Lucy as before, kindly pro-\ miSed me her assistance, but knew not what to do.

My Sister was greatly Surprized at this •change in her friends behaviour. As for me, I was entirely confunded. It was with difficulty, I recovered my Scattered SenSes. My sister not yet fully recovered from her Surprize, desired the particulars of our short conversation.
I told her the whole. The starting tear approached her eye; stie Said she pitied me; and feared her heart was already^ engaged. This dist.f-asted me, I dreaded as much my Self.
I desired her if possible, to gain me another interview, that I might be fully informed of my fate.

I gladly consented to the conditions,

Charlotte at length Set out ; she being : gone, I hastened our departure as much as I possibly could; and my worthy friend and my sister, who were ever ready to oblige me, complied with my request to depart the enSuing week.
I took a Sorrowful farewell of my indulgent parents; my father having first taken care to give me diredlions how to receive any remittances I should want; with ample instrudlions how to behave my' Self in foreign countries.

LETTER XIi:
WE had an agreeable journey. We travelled in Mr. Honor’s coach, and by eaSy stages, at length arrived at the justly famed metropolis of this kingdom, v/ithout being in the least fatigued.
A very handSome houfe genteely furnished in Saint James’s fqiiare was, by Mr. Honor’s orders, ready for our reception. . My friend insisted on my reSiding with him during my stay in town, to which I could not deny my assent. •
Mr. Honor was 'U acquainted with London and with every thing curious in , E.4^	it.
8-0 MEMOIRS of
it. My sister had as well as mySelf expreff fed a desire of Seeing Something of the city. He offered to be our conduDer, and to .shew us the principal things, that were worthy of our observation.
The next day the coach was ordered to the door. We got in, and drove towards the city, th:at being she first excursion,, we intended to make.
We took a view of that magnificent piece of building. Saint Paul’s; which justly claims the particular attention of strangers. As I had not yet Seen any of the Italian models, I was not So capable of judging of the particular beauties, elegancies, and defeds of this piece of mo*
' dern architedlure.
Several things I must confeSs gave me then and afterward diSgust, eSpecially the point of view, which ought at least to be as'far distant as Temple Bar, in my opinion; but as it Is now Situated, there is not room to take a proSpedt 'of it. In regard to the prd'ent situation, what prof- . . pedl there might otherwiSe have been, is destroyed by that long received Superstitious notion, of erefting any place of worship due East and West, as if the
COHr
Mr. Charles Guildford. Sr
congregation were designed to worship the rising Sun.
I could never conceive that there was jiny fixed point, to which we were to direct our prayers; but that the deity is at all times, and in every instant of time, in every part of boundleSs Space.
I have, since my return from Italy taken another view of Saint Paul’s; and re- ,* ally think there are Several fiiults in that building, that are easily diScernable to a competent judge.
Not only the portico but the whole, structure itielf, is on the outSide, divided into two stories ; which conSequendy indicates the Same division v:ithin, which i.s abSurd. The portico, I think should have projected farther, which would have ^ . given a grander contrast to the front, and aided the perSpeftive within.
If the dome had been raiSed in the centre of the whole, and two Spires added to the East end, to anfwer thoSe at the West with proper ornaments; it would have made a great addition to it.
There are Several other exceptions to be ta'ken to it^ which I need not notice to you, as you are yourSelf- a competent judge; but vet, notwithstanding Some K 5	fau Itg,
Si MEMO IRS of
faults, I think it is a grand and magniiff cent pile, and an ornament to the nation in general.
If the architedls plan had been exadlly followed, what a glorious city would ' London have been, and what a magnificent profpedl would Saint Paul’s have given : the whole city itfelf with the addition' of Such a church properly Situated, would have been the wonder of the world.
Sir Christopher Wren laid down a plan ■ . wherein w’'as a design for one large Spacious Street, to reach from lAldgate to Temple Bar, in the middle of which was to have been a large Square, capable oS . , containing Saint Paul’s church, round which would have been a proper distance for a viev/ of the whole. So that it would not then have been confined, and penned up as ’tismow, where it can’t be Seen to^ any advantage; but there would have been a long ample vista at each end, . to have reconciled it to a proper point of view.
'He alSo propofed to build-all the parish churches in Such a manner, as to be Seen at the end of every vista of houSes, and	i
So diSpoSed in their distances from each
other
\
Mr. Charles Guildford. ,83
other, as not to appear confuSed in the proSpedl ; which would have given a proper heightening to the whole bulk of the City, as it filled the landshape : and alio to build the diouSes uniform, and Sup- . ported on a piazza like thoSe of Covent Garden, and by the waterside, from the. Bridge to the Temple, along broad v,/harf where he designed to have ranged all the halls belonging to the Several Companies of the City, with proper wharehouSes for merchants and to vary the Edifices, and • , make it one of the most beautiful and moSt uSeful ranges of building in the world.
The great Fire, gave them a proper opportunity, to carry Such a glorious Scheme into execution ; what a pity stwas /	' not done !
The fame of Such a city would have attracted the attention of the whole world and have drav/n Foreigners of all nations to have viewed it; Vv^hich would in time have paid for the building of the whole.
Tile buildings in London are many of them expensive, but inelegant or So badly situated as to be hid from our fight.
The next 'place we visited was the Exchange. This is certainly a costly, grand extensive fabrick but it w'ants an ample E 6	area
84	E M O I R S of
area before it, that d. perSon might at one view be capable of comprehending the whole, and not be obliged to view it in parcels which destroys the intent of the the thing, and confuSes the obferver. But the vast concourSe of people I there Saw, attradled my Attention too much, for me to regard the Architedlure of this noble struDurc with that due observance, I had. intended to bestow on every piece of art I found in this city, worthy of my observation.
I was .greatly Surprized, as the coach drove along througli the city, to See the innummerable crowds of people tliat thronged along the streets ; but I was much more SurpriSed at change, to See Such an assembly of men, whom 1 confidered as representatives of all the different parts of the earth. Merchants that traffick from pole to pole, from east to west, and to the uttermost bounds of our Globe.
How much buSineSs, Says I to mySelf is there tranSacled on- this Small Spot of ground. Agreements made, and transactions carried on, whoSe influence reach to the farthest parts of the Earth. The whole globe itSelf is here traverSed^ and concerns Settled though at the greatest
distance
Mr. Charles Guildford. S5
distance. The commerce of the kingf dom is extended to every Nation, principality, dominion and people under the Sun.
In short my Satisfaction would have continued much longer, but I was reminded, by my friend that stwas time to pfcceed on our excursion.
We left the Exchange, and from thence proceeded to the Bridge, where we had a proSpeCl of the river and stripping, and likewi e of a great part of the City which v/ith the distant view, gave us the Prof-peCt of a delightful landsicape. The buildings that are upon the bridge are a very great incumbrance, L think, and gives it a very diSagreeable look.
What a delightful profpeCt would it give, if it was freed from that incum---b ranee.
From the Bridge we drove to the Tower an antient venerable place ; but really I can’t praife it much, either for its beauty, strength, or magnificence.
Whilst we were down at Bath, I had taken a ride to Bristol ; where we staid two or three days, to view the stripping &c. I think that is^ a firre Sea-port town, that carries on a large trade. There are a
great
86 M E M O I R S of
great' number of ships belonging to itL and many continually coming there. They have a very fine quay, where their shipping lies, near a mile and a half in length, which is continually crowded with ships from all parts of the world ; and the quay from one end to the other, appears, by reaSon of the vast number of masts, ropes, &c. like a large forest in. won ter.
d’he ssiips of war don’t come up to Bristol, but commonly anchor at King-road.
But to return to London. We walk’d down a considerable way, by the side of the Thames. How happy and how great is London, nay even the whole Kingdom rendered by that fine river; which proudly Swelling bears So many rich and Stately ships! ships without number, that lie in many places on this fine river, on each Side for many, miles.
How far in number do they exceed thoSe at Bristol, or of any other Sea-port town in England or perhaps in the known' world. And what a glorious appearance would they make, if they lay altogether in regular order! but that would be inconvenient, for the number of ships far ex-

eeeds thoSe of Bristol, the wharfs and quays be distinft and Separate and there is greater room.
.Dis^ not for Bristol or any other Seaport in this nation, to stand in Competion with London, the Metropolis of the kingdom, and tho’ Sir Christopher Wren’s plan, was not followed, yet ’tis still in-many reSpedls perhaps the finest City in^ the whole world.

Tlte Monument is I think a noble column, and may in many reSpeds justly vie-with the most celebrated ones of antiquity. It is bold, beautiful, just, and harmonious ; and the baSs relief at the bale is finely performed. It’s a very great pity that it is So badly situated.

Saint Dunstan’s church is incumbered with shops, and is only a deformed incumbrance itSelf. It Spoils the beauty of Fleet-street, and the proSpedt of Temple-Bar.
Many churches in and about London are So much crowded at the entrance, that they are Scarce perceived by a stranger when passing along the streets.
The Strand a fine noble street ; and which is the grand channel of communication between London and Westminster is greatly and very improperly crowded, with a very large body of buildings, extending from the Butcher Row to the New Church.
The New Church in the Strand is a pretty building, and is Sufficiently decorated to pleaSe the ignorant, but not to appear even agreeable to a good judge. It is all Ornament without proper vacuities to relieve the Eye, and give an agreeable, contrast to the whole that is absolutely necessary. ’Tis alSo divided into two stories which has ruined its Simplicity, and broke the whole into too many parts.

I
^ 1
Mr. Charles GutiOFORD. 9.7
1 could have Spent my whole time at Mr. Worthy’s for I was now. very intimate there; few families v/ith whom I was acquainted lived So happy or gave me So much pleaSure, exclusive of my regard for the younger branch of it; as that v/or-thy and honoui’able family did. All was peaceful, happy and Serene.
Our family was as harmonious, and So might another in which I was acquainted, had it not been for the unhappy temper I	of a woman, who was d, miSery to herSelf
and all that knew her, and which was en-I	tirely owing to her ownshad temper.
Mr. James ThompSon, a divine, was the hushand of this gentlewoman. A marl ^	that was pious, just and good. He had
read much, was poffeffed of all the Social f	virtues ; well acquainted with the duties
of his fun Dion; and performed them ae-cordingly.
He was what might be called a good man, but his wife a termag;int. I have often compared the good man to Socrates for patience, and hiswite to the termagant Xantippe.
She was Seldom eaSy or pleafed at any thing he either Said, did, or adviSed. He

MiSs BetSy, the daughter of Mr Thompson by a former wife, was a genteel, free, good-natured young lady, very much re-iembling her father in good humour, and of a mild and agreeable temper. *
This young lady, the unkind stepmother mortally hated; and endeavoured by every means she could deviSe, to ruin her in her father’s good opinion ; but he as a prudent, wife man, hearkened not to the many siy insinuations she often made; she at length found it im.pracsticable, and was I believe for that reafon reSolved to harraSs the poor girl out of her life; vrhich she might easily have effedled, if the young lady had not had fo excellent a tutor, to	I
instruct; her how to bear with her step-mo-	i
ther’s furious temper.
How
Mr. Charles Guildford. 99
How ridiculous did this lady make hcr-felf appear, in the eyes of all who knew her.
Her relations, her acquaintance, in short every one who knew her dissiked her. No one was pleaSed with any thing she Said or did, at least but Seldom, though it was ever So commendable, nor ever v/ould, unlefs she had formed a reSolution ‘ never to offend or appear diSagreeable ; if file had done that she might have regained that favonr and affedlion, she had by her own imprudence lost.
One day Something had happened to disturb her. When dinner was Sent in she looked at it, then at the Servants, then at MrThompSon, with Such a furious, angry viSage; that plainly indicated the uneaSmefs, and rancour of her heart.
She uttered Several diSreSpedlful words ' in a restrained, but angry tone. Mr. I hompSon, like a good mild man. Seemed to obServe it not; but roSe with all the Sv/eetneSs imaginable, craved a blessing on his frugal repast. Sat down compoSed-ly, desired me to eat, begged leave to help me, &c. and Spoke with all the milJneSs Imaginable. She looked on hi u only v/ith eyes of diSdain and contempt, F 2	and
\

and Sat frowning, reddening, staring and at length burst; into a violent passion.
How uneaiy must the preSence of Such a perSon render me ? I think you my dear friend must be fully Sensible, what my situation must be at that time. How many ladies, who are mistresses of families, wsh, whilst at table, behave wdth polite-neSs, complacency and good nature to :their guests ; and at the Same time give -their Servants, for the least fault imaginable, and often for none, the most pierc-, ing. Surly,’ ill-natured looks; which must conSeciuently give their guests more anxiety than all their complacency can make amends for.
I really think, if it is intended for a corredtion of any fault a Servant is guilty of, it is not only highly imprudent, but very ungenerous not to their Servants only, but iikewiSe to their friends that are prefent; the Servant is only provoked and confided by stich a procedure, and by that means comiriits many blunders, which they mieht not otherwiSe have been guilty of, and friends are hurt, as fupposing theiiifelves the innocent occasson of the yiihole.
But

Mr. Charles Guildford, ‘ioi
But Mrs. ThompSon, instead of endeavouring to behave in a complaiSant manner, rather endeavoured to affront thgSe • whom her hushand esteemed as his friends, and thought proper Sometimes to invite to Spend an hour or two with him. *
Mr. ThompSon was but too Sensible of this, and Seldom invited any but partied- , lar friends, whoSe discretion he could confide in, and whoSe good SenSe and gaod nature he could depend upon. Mrs. Thompson could, whenever she^pleaSed, behave to her company with Inimitable grace and good manners, but when she did at any time behave in the ridiculous manner I have before mentioned, Mr. ThompSon endeavoured to divert the attention of his guests, from the disagreeable Scene, and to make amends by his own good-nature, and plealant conversation, for the foibles of his termagant wife.

My last, I dare fay, on account of the Subjedt, was diSagreeable enough. I shall now drop the family affairs of my friend Mr. ThompSon, and give you a more particular description of his character and life.
He constantly attended divine Service himSelf; unleSs inevitable neceshty prevented him. Though his income was but Small, yet he performed many charitable acts with it. He relieved many poor distress’d families; visited their sick beds; and gave them whatever relief ' he possibly could; Supplied them with healthful restoratives, and gave them that conSolation his function required from him.
His friendly visits were frequent according as occasions required. He often lamented his inability of doing good offices to thoSe that merited his bounties; faying, it was a thing he could not bear, to lee our fellow creatures wanting the common necessaries of life, and not afford them Some assistance. ,
He
Mr. Charles Guildford. 103
He took all the care he could rhat the children of the poor should be educated and brought up in a proper knowledge of the deity, that they imbibed Sound principles, and right notions and ideas of things, and gave them Sussicient instructions to ,	guard, in Some Sort, against the evils cf liSe;
and to free their minds from the common errors and prejudices of the vulgar Sort.
His Sermons, his lectures, his diScourSes and conversations, were full of excellent morality; given in the plainest manner and yet dressed in the most perSuaSive eloquence; the meanest capacity might with eaSe imbibe thoSe excellent rules he laid down for the canduct of life, to guide them to a. happpy eternity; whilst the most judicious perSon must be highly plea-Sed and delighted with the language that stowed from his lips.
His conversation amongst friends, was free and eaSy; and at the Same time that it was plcaSant and agreeable, was alSo improving ; his behaviour was affable and polite; his opinion on, and observation of things just and true, and his refiections proper, and prudently made.
How many excellent diScourSes have I heard him make on various Subjects 1 F 4	How

I dined with him one day when a young gentleman that was there Seemed to take particular notice of Mrs. ThompSon’s behaviour, v:ho at that time happened to be in a very bad humour.
MiSs BetSy v:as at table, to whom the chief of her malice and ill-will Seemed to be directed; but the young lady, in return, behaved in the most engaging, and ' agreeable manner, and with Such civility and good nature as must have charmed any, but the most obdurate and Savage heart. When dinner was over, and the ladies were v/ithdrawn; the young gentleman by his diScourSe, shewed himSelf an inveterate enemy to matrimony, railed at it tor a confidcrable time ; and threw out Several Scurrilous, indecent reflections against a Sex, which he did not, by his physiognomy Seem to hate; So much as he would by his diScourSe have insinuated.
When the young gentleman had made nn end oS his ridiculous diScourSe,	!
he ashed Mr. d'hoippSon his opinion upon	j
that Subject,
“ Why

<« Why Sir,” Says the doctor, “ I will “ give you my opinion in as few w^ords as possible. You have run on in the “ most ludicrous strain imaginable ahd “ railed at matrimony, which is the most	|
“ honourable and happy state on earth.
“ A state that was originally deSigned by ‘‘ the Almighty, as a blessing to man^
“ kind. ’Tis the chief end of the crea-tion, and woman is one of the most beautiful parts of it. They were de-‘‘ signed as a relief to the cares of man,
“ Woman when good and virtuous Seems “ to be Something more than mortal.”
“ Every one is not good. ’Tis not to “ be expected. Human nature is too “ far depraved. If any of the Sex are , bad, we should commifferate them, and “ the worSe they are, the greater ought “ our pity and compassion to be for thoSe “ unhappy fairones; but there are not So “ many are as good as fair.”	_	<
“ Perhaps Some instances which you “ have Seen of Mrs. ThompSon’s unhappy “ temper, being a liitie too warm, has ‘‘ given you encouragement to talk in the manner you have done, as you per-“ haps expeded my approbation of your F 5.	“ diff'

diScourfe, but | will affure you, if that “ is the caSe, yoil' are greatly mistaken. >
“ Your SuSpjcions of the Sex in general “ are wrong, and your bad opinion un-“ justly grounded. If I thought it was “ poffible to eradicate thoSe falSe notions “ you have imbibed, I would endeavour “ to do it, but I am afraid it would be a “ fruitleSs labour..
“ Mrs. 7'hompSon’s temper is not Such / as I could wish, but in other reSpedlsshe ‘MS a good and worthy woman; and in my “ opinion makes ample amends for that “ one failing: I therefore hope the Supreme “ being will accept of the atonement; she “ is pious, virtuous and charitable ; but is “ not at all times able to Subdue her tei>
“ bulent passions; and where is the wiSest “ man that can ?
“ The impetuosity of her temper is “ natural, and I never withstand it, but “let it like a torrent rush on, and by de-grees it destroys itSelf and Subsides into “ a gentle calm. When she is cool, i “ give her the best advice I can, how to “ Subdue thoSe paffions which Sometimes	^
“ gain a Superiorly over her reaSon, and	C
cool reflection brings her to a due	T
“ SenSe of her fault, which she readily ac-

“ knowledges, and endeavours to amend. •
“ What can a man, a reaSonable one at “ least desire more.”
How prudent was this behaviour, if his diScourSe was not absolutely true? Mr. ThompSon proceeded.
“ I therefore beg you will never at-'	“ tempt to take any liberties with me, or
“ offer to Say any thing injurious of the	|
“ Sex, or throw out any diSreSpectfulhintS,
“ that may in the least relate to Mrs.

“ Wliat an infinite blessing is a good “ wife ? She lightens, and eafes our la-N bouring breasts of the one half of our “ cares. She adds greatly to, and par-“■ takes of our plcaSures, which makes jr '	“ them far more agreeable. She is our

My dear friend, I must just bring you acquainted with my lord simple, who was the perSon that gave me the interruption men ioned in my last; and take my leave, having a little affair to diSpatch that requires my immediate pretence.
My lord was formerly a perSon of fashion and fortune. He had lived the life of a debauchee fome time, and not having a very large share of SenSe or judgement, was by his expensive pleaSures drawn into mortgage his estate for a ; pretty large Sum, which was Soon Spent; he then took up more money, v/hich his follies, with the assistance of Some uSurers and knaves that Surrounded him. Soon destroyed ; and he was just ready to fall a prey to poverty and miSery, when meeting with a citizen’s daughter of a large fortune, he paid his addresses to her. The young lady being desirous of a title, and her parents being as willing as their daughter, to conclude a match with this uoUe-man, and as fond of the honor ; my lord

kept genteel company, and lived in the most extravagant manner. In a few years they had leveral children, who had the	;
melancholy proSpedl of being rendered , nnSerable by their father’s, I may Say their parents folly. The estate was going again in the fame manner as before. My	!
lady herSelf was very extravagant, and I	*
had a hint given me when I was in London, and became acquained with them,	'
•that her ladyship had conSented to make an alsignment of her jointure, in order to 'shpport that grandeur they had So long lived in. What a proSpeft -was this for "the helpleSs infants ! My lady was pretty	y
haughty, and their werefew below herown dignity, whom she would condefeend to tx>nverfe with.
She had feveral times, after her marri-lage deSired her father to leave of businefs 'and Itee at the polite end of the town.

My lord and his lady asiisted them in their laudable defign, and when I return’d from my tour, the father and mother had with grief for their folly, and a dread of poverty and miiery dropt into the cold and silent grave. My lord and his lady were obliged to retire to the country; where they now live upon a Imall estate and fome allowance from the crown, fcarcely fusheient to fupport them as private people.

E R E is more charaDers following , j[ .ny friend ; its what you desire, and 1 mull comply. The next that I shall give you is that of Jemmy Prim, an af-fcdled formal fop, a mere coxcomb.
He was a young fellow that was tolerably well made, but not contented with the face that nature had given him, he uSually attempted to mend it with paint.
Having but a Imall fortune his friends had put him clerk to one Mr. Chicane an attorney in town.
jemmy preferred gay company, and . the diversions of the town, to the study of the law, and Seldom gave my lord Littleton or his famousteommentorany trouble.
There was a young lady whoSe name was .
Gay, who lometimes visited us, that introduced him to our acquaintance. They ' were distant relations. She wa§ a mere coquet, and uled Sometimes to gallant it with her cousin, v/ho had Such a good opinion of his own dear formal phiz, and well made body, that he imagineo; every young lady that looked at hirr;, must ne-	j

The young lady, willing to divert her-Self, and her acquaintance at the wretch’s expence, Seemed to encourage his ad-	i
dresses and the notions.he had entertain’d, . ; uSed him as one of her constant dang-	:•
Icrs, and in return, made him appear in the m.ost ridiculous light wherever she	'

Had she behaved othcrwiSe the poor young fellow would not have appeared to any great advantage in company, dreSs and dangling after the ladies being all he understood.	'	*

He Loon discovered his ignorance and that he had received but a very indifferent education.
I'lie liberal arts he was entirely ignorant of, and very little verSed in common School learning. He had a Sorry ambling v/it, which he often-endeavoured to Spur on, by throwing out a wretched pun, endeavouring at a quick repartee or Sometimes giving you a word which he inten-!	ded as a dotible Kn tend re, when perhaps

That though Some were not So just as they ought to be, yet that he knew Several honest worthy gentlemen that belonged to, and professed the law, and that he did not in the least doubt but that there were ’many Such.
The young gentleman confessed, that Mr. Honor was right in what he had advanced, but in anSwer to it, gave us Several instances of dishonest pradlice in his master, and Several others concerned with him, which were Scarce credible, and for that reaSon I shall not here relate any of them. As to the profeffion it is honourable, and as to the professors it is dishonourable to ssing an odium upon a whole body, for the faults of a few individuals.

My dear friend since I v/rote 1113?
last, I have accidentaly met with a -ientiment similar to my own in what I mentioned in that letter,, on. condemning a collcDive body oS men or a whole profession &c. for the faults of a few individi;*, ' als. It is I think much better expreffetf ' than my own, therefore I shall beg leave to give it you in thq authors, own words after giving a fliort abstradl of Some previous observations. It is taken from a letter in the Spedlator No. 537.
Amongst other things the author obScrves that the Spcdbator has in Some of his Speculations asserted to his readers the Dignity of Human Nature. The author of that letter thereon obServes that the Spe(flators carmot be-inSenSiblq that thes is a contro-vcited dodSrine, that there are authors who conSider human nature in a very, different view and that books of maxim.s have been written to shew the Ealsity of of all human Virtues.

stances to prove his assertion. He therr proceeds and Says that “ from all theSe hands we have Such draughts of man-' “ kind, as are represented in thoSe,bur-“ ksique piDures, which the Italians calt Caricature’s where the art consists in-^ preserving amidst distorted proportions “ and aggravated features. Some distih-“ guishing likeneSs of the perSon, but in “ Such a manner as to transform the most a-“ agreeable beauty into the most odious ‘‘ monster.”
This tlio’ not immediately applicable to the Subjed; I was upon, yet is in Some meaSure, but I have mentioned it for the Sake of the following resseclion which is apropos, and which I' give in the authors words viz.
“ It is very dillngenuous to level the “ best of mankind with the worst, and “ for the faults of parricu’ars to degrade ^ the whole Species-: Such methods tend ‘‘ not only to remove a man’s good opinion “ of others, but to destroy that reverence for liimSeff, which is a great guard of “ innocence, and a Spring of virtue.”
I shall not quote any more, time will not permit.—But refer you to the letter' leaving.. given you a Specimen to induce G 5	you
130 ^ M E M O I k S of
you to read it.—But don’t you think the-expressions neat, and the refiedtion applicable to the Subjedl of my last ?

Soon after the conversation we had with Jemmy on his profeffion^ &c. We miffed both him and his cousin for Sometime, we wondered at their abSence, and the rather, os it Seldom exceeded three or four days.
Upon enquiry after them, as we fear’d Something extraordinary had happened, we had the following account given us	J
by a perSon that we had reaSon to believe v/as well acquainted with the whole. MiSs Gay and a young gentleman who had for Sometime paid his addresses to her, were one evening at a place of public, diversion. The gentleman had ordered a collation, and lome choice wines to be prepared which when ready, he invited his mistreSs to partake of.
She was very warm, and not in the least fearing any accident, drank more freely than ever she had done before.
They were in a pleaSant private harbour,, when the lady being in high Spirits, the lo.

I’he lover, who did not entertain a very extraordinary opinion of the lady’s virtue occasioned by her constant coqucttry, kid c!oSe_ Siege to her notwithstanding the repulSe he had met with, and pushed boldly on, till the fair one at length half	;

My dear friend we are now coming* into more polite life. Prepare yourielf for an acquaintance witii lady Fondle: and her Lap-Dog. yousil ex-cuSe me, 1 hope for making her ladyship’s Lap-Dog a party, when 1 affure you that this little curious beast is not of the common Sort, but one of the most extraordi-^ nary creatures that ever was formed, ac	,
least, her fair mistrefs thought So.
'	; A Richlieu, a Mazarine, or even a great ■ !
-----has not received more com pit-
ments from fawning, cringing courtiers,	^
or Sycophants and flatterers than Chloe.	,
L-ady Fondle was a lady of a very large	i
and extensive fortune, of extraordinary	i
beauty and pretty good parts ; a lively wit inclined to raillery and fatire. Her ac-	>
complishments and fortune rendered her one of the first ladies of the british court, and she was in high Savour there.
■ /	She studied her glaSs a considerable
part of her time, for fine' airs, curious glances, &c. yet did not in the mean time forget her charming Chloe. Chloe was-
,	her
Mr. Charles Guildford. 135
her ladyship’s chief companion during the time she Spent at the glaSs, taking a look at each alternately, first peruSing the charms of her own beauteous form, then viewing thoSe of her lovely Chloe.
No one attempted admittance to her ladyship, before they had first paid their compliments to Chloe,, if she was in the way, that being the only meshod to gain the lady’s favour..
Her ladyship’s lovei-s were all extremely fond of the little creature, in proportion-to the love for the’fair owner, judge then how numerous must be the compliments paid to this favourite.
Any one that v/anted the lady’s interest to gain a favour at court, first ingratiated themSelves into Chloe’s good will, that being the only way to attracl lady Fon-dle’s notice, or gain her esteem.
Mr. Honor being of an ancient and; honourable family, was esteemed by the I	nobility &c. as of their own rank, and
they associated with him accordingly..
He was introduced to lady Fondle Soon,
'	after our arrival in town. He in general
liked her ladySnip, but did not approve of the common method. uSually made uSe

of to gain her favour, nor did he attempt!. it, at the expence of his SenSe, by courting her ladyship’s Lap-Dog, a beast he was not extremely fond of.
Her ladyship was Sensible of Mr. Ho--nor’s intirnSic merit, and she Seemed to entertain the regard of a friend fon him. He appeared amiable and deServ-ing in her ladyship’s eyes, and she behaved to him with a particular complaiSance„ as to a man of merit and worth ; whom she esteemed,as Such, yet would Sometimes* prettily reSent the affront»-he oliered to her little Chloe.
Her ladyssiip ScaTce ever visited any; where without Chloe, and there was not one, Mr. Honor excepted, who held any-plaxe in. her ladyship’s esteem imleSs Chloe was a favourite with them.
She was always stroking, kishng, and hugging oS the dear creature, and often protested in my hearing that she really believed was her dear Chloe to die, she should expire the Same moment.
O I how ridiculous, but obServe. A misfortune Soon happens that require all her ladyship’s fortitude.
Chloe had always eat at the Same table*,^ and in the iame- genteel manner, as her
mistteSs.

inistreSs. I'lie finest china, or the most curious plate, were Scarce good enough for the dainty beast.
China bought at the greatest price, and the most cutious glasses &c. her ladyship had, were often broke by Chloe, who was very unlucky. The fair lady’s temper on Such occasions would Somietimes be disturbed, and her Servants commonly felt the effects of her anger,.
Chloe had no moderation in eating, and this Spoiled its digestion. Fine rich turkey carpets, and velvet cushions, silk and damafk furniture, &c. was in common uSe with this little puny Sickly animal who often Spoiled it.
The like effc(fls of courfe enSued as in other misdemeanors, and rendered Chloe hateful to the domesticks. Several who had not paid their compliments to her,; Jiad been diSdiarged; others had istet witli tlie Same fate by, their careieSsneSs in attending on her; and Several were diS^ charged without their wages, and lost) rheir characters if they offered in the least to be impertinent.
By theSe and other means Chloe lofu tjie esteem pf the Servants in general,
and.

and at length a conspiracy was formed to destroy the poor deliquent, without either judge or jury.
Chloe Soon after this reSolution was made, died of a burning fever, notwithstanding the best advice and assistance was given her. They were unanimouOy of opinion that the patient h«d been inhumanly poiSoned, and many of her lady-' .	^ ships Servants were immediately discharg-
ed on Suspicion, and new ones established in their places.
Her ladyship shut heisielf up, and weeped, moaned, and lamented in the most immoderate manner, fully reSolved’ that nothing but Chloe’s return to life should ever comfort her. An admirer of . the lady’s, being acquainted with the caufe of his fair mistreSs’s grief, one day desired admission to her ladyship, which was for Sometime refilled, according to her ladyship’s strifl orders not to admit any one, except a particular friend or two to condole with her.
The lover, often repeating an affurance he had given her ladyship’s attendants	i|
that he had a certain and effectual rem.cdy	;
for her preSent grief, and accompanying his request with a liberal preSent, whidi
ht:

he had before forgot; he was admitted,
'	into her ladyship’s appartment, where the
i	fair mourner Sat weeping on her Settee.
/	The lady not being informed of his ap-
proach, on his entrance started, but reco-' ■	vering from her Surprize, and daitipg a
furious look at him, she enquired the rea-fon of his prefent intrusion. The gentle-
Iman immediately produced a beautSul
Lap-Dog, very much Tike the deceaSed -Chloe, which he preSented to. her ladyship, and hoped that would plead his ex-cuSe. The lady received the pretty creature with an cxtaSy of joy, put it to her Si	boSom, and almost Smothered it with
kisses. Her ladyship in about half an hoiir’s time Sufficiently recolleSled herSelf to return her lover thanks for his curious an.l cxtraordina.ry preSent, and affared him she would alvrays gratefully remem-ii	ber his prtSent kindneSs. The lover em-

LETTER XXII.
, /f L- Honor had not been long in i.VA town before a gentleman in an old rusty coat that had formerly been black, a peruke which might originally perhaps in the time of Charles the first, be a Sort of dark grizzle, but had now lost its colour, the hair grown strelght, a Sword, which Sometimes Saw the light for the benefit of oiling, but was now put on with a fine old fashioned belt to adorn the worthy owner, and which had been carefully preserved through Several reigns, but was " mow grown venerable for its antiquity. A shirt with a pair of ruffles well wore, and a neckcloth of the Same kind, with other things Suitable, begged admission to him.
The gentleman before deScribed was admitted to him in his cloSet, (for the meanest < perSon was never denied admittance,) and after staying Some time he departed, Seeming very well pleaSed.
Mr. Honor afterwards informed me,	.. '
that this gentleman’s name was Mr. QLiill	^
an author by profession, who had not met with the fucceSs he expected in the diSpo-
Sal
[
Mr. Charles Guildford. 143
fal of his pieces, and was therefore very poor.
He had preSented Mr. Honor a Small piece containing a few chara{5lers. The piece if printed, might perhaps make a Small pamphlet. Mr. Honor had peruSed it during the author’s stay, being unwilling to give him unnecessary trouble. The author was not desirous of publishing it, if he could get any thing by it without. Mr. Honor gave him ten guineas, and he w^as very well Satisfied with the SucceSs of his piece, and never returned for it, tho* Mr. Honor told him he might have it a-gain alter he had shewn it to a friend or two, if he thought he could get any thing of the bookseller for it; but the old gen-i	tleman assured him he had rather not ap-
ply to any of them as he was already Sufficiently Satisfied and that ’twas now be-*	come Mr. Honor’s property.
1	I will to oblige you give you a short
I	'■ extract from Some, at least Such principal
f.	parts as I can remember. In the first
■	' place Squire Curious preSents himSelf to
^	your view, a gentleman of a pretty large
fortune and good family.
He was fo far infatuated with the notion of being an extraordinary virtuoSo that
he
I
t44 M E M O I R S of
he expended the greatest part of his fortune in purchasing things of no real value except antiquity could stamp a value on ,	'
them, or that any thing uncommon in	'
the courSe of nature, could by Such a bor-tion be esteemed of more intrinsic worth.
Whatever proportion their value bore in tire esteem of others, antiquity or Somes-thing strange, was the quantity and quasi-	'
ty noted by him, and the more antique or more strange any thing was the greater price be paid for the curious bauble.
He had after many years industry, and	|
with very great expence, got a fine collec-	'
tion of curious trifles, almost compleat	'
(if it would ever have been compleared)	^
but alas he died, and left the whole be- ,	,
hind him, for any that would or could purchaSe them. His wife and children were left to Seek their future Support from, the Sale of his expensive treaSure, at least	|
if stwas not a treaSure, the whole cost an immenSe one.
But enough of Squire Curious. The next is Mr, Lancet, a gentleman who having kept a stall on tower-hill to Sell Second hand p'amphlets, &c. at length turned Surgeon, and Set himSelf forth in
the
Mr. Charles Guildford. 145
j	the publick papers for a famous man, of
many years pradtice. The vulgar herd being often troubled with a diSeale which \	is the necessary conSequence of a de-
I	bauched life, applied to the new Surgc-
'	on for privacy and cheapneSs, who Soon
!	got money, took a handSome houSe, pur-
chaSed good furniture, stepped into his chariot, appeared gay, and passed for a I	gentleman ; in his own opinion at least.
A fee often Secures him from an inquiry by the regular bred Surgeons, whole officious honesty is not Sufficient to make them resist the temptations of a bribe, for ,	a falSe return.
i	But London I find is now well stocked
with common quacks of all Sorts. Tlie !	most common fellows from the dregs of
,j	the people turn dodtors,	Surgeons, chy-
mists, &c. and being of	honourable families keep their chariots	&c. with their
arms, I was going to Say	(borrowed, or
whoSe they are, I know not, j to Supporc '	their ancient dignity,
i	But this is descending too low, hov/e-
j	ver to make amends give me leave to
;	make a uSeful refiedtion or two. What do
thele public common quacks perform ?
VoL. I.	H	destroy

i4si M E M O I R S of
destroy the health, and endanger the lives and Safety of many of his Majesty’s foolish Subjedls; who vainly hope a cure, from thofe ignorant wretches, who know not the nature of the diSeaSe, they pretend to remedy.
They tamper with their patients until they in their great wiSdom pronounce them incurable, and often render them So; a regular lurgeon is then applied to, and if not too late he Searches to the bottom of the diSeaSe and is at infinite trouble to undo the whole of what the other has been So long doing, and when this is done, the cure is then begun and	I
all this to the very great miSery and torture of the Suffering patient, and if. he is at length cured ’tis at an immenSe cxpence which might have been Saved if a proper application had at first been	i
made.	'
But quacks are not the only perSons who delerve cenSure. The regular bred phyficlan. Surgeon &c. is oftentimes guib ty of impositions nay villainies, which	,
any reaSonable mast would esteem inexcuf-able in the greatest Barbarians. They often trifle away the lives of thouSands
and
i
Mr. Charles Guildford. 147
tmd kill Secundem Artcm., where nature itSelf would cure, if left free to operate.
A quack Sometimes gains fame as well as a physician, where neither deServe it. If the quack has shill Sufficient to find out the nature of the diSeale, and that nature will, if not obstriKsted, perform the deSired cure, it is a happy moment wherein to establish his fame. He may apply a few Simples which he knows are inof-fenfive, and if the patient recovers, stwas the dodtor performed the cure. If the dodlors shill is Sufficiently known, his shme established, and he can Safely give the preference to the increaSe of his wealth if his patient be rich, rather than to his reputation, medicines are then applied to continue the deSeaSe, and prevent a recovery. If the patient dies, stwas the diSeaSe not the doctor that killed.
The regular physician in this particular agrees with the pretender to physic. A quack may Sometimes perform a cure but ten to one if stis with a recipe of his own invention, but with one he has either borrowed or purchased.
.	I have known Several instances of male-
pradlicc which are Scarce credible. How cruel! to keep a patient lingering in the ^	H 2	greatest
I4S MEMOIRS of
greatest miSery, till the diSeaSe grows incurable and thereby throw the miSerable lufferer into the ocean cf eternity, before the destined time according to the com-	1
mon courle of nature. An expensive bill of courSe Succeeds. That to the rich, the poor are tortured for experience. T he poor are regarded by few, yet when they enter the lists for the immortal prize they stand the fairer chance, the rich being liable to far greater temp ations.
The poor ought not therefore to be	i
deSpiSed as our great creator makes no	j
distindion but by good works. That Sa-crilegeous pradice of robbing the earth of	1
its buried inhabitants, is shocking to humanity Scarce any but the corps of the poor Suffer this violation, becaule none will de-	,
fend the rem.ains of the indigent deceaSed. - i Is experience to be gained at the expence	!
of honour, humanity, and virtue! shock- > ing to every hum.ane heart!
There are many unhappy wretches cut off by the Sword of justice; they are more proper. But what a horrid pradice is it to encourage a villain to drag the interr’d	i
body of a worthy perSon from the grave	,
which one would think a Susheient shelter,
and
Mr. Charles Guildford. 149
and mangle it in the most inhuman manner.
'i'he antient Heathen’s knew not this custom. The most barbarous nations never were acquainted with it. But as Tra-jau Bocalini Says, “ One dodlor formerly was enough to cure a hundred diSeaSes,
“ and now a hundred doctors are not “ enough to cure one diSea'e.” I shall here give you a renTiish.able in.lance which confirms the above.
A gentleman had got a trifling wound in hi.s leg, a Surgeon was Sent for: he dreSSed it, ’till the fleSn mortified and the bone became foul. Some more gentlemen of the faculty were called in. A consultation held, the leg pronounced inciir-able, and they agreed to cut it off. The gentleman was informed of their resolution, and would not conSent to the operation, until he had had the opinion of an bid woman in Greenwich much famed for her extraordinary fkill in Surgery &c. The ‘ gentlemen were affronted; he insisted upon it and she was Sent for. <She examined the wound. Several terms of art were propoSed to her to breed confusion, she anSwered she understood not the'terms but could cure the wound. The gentle-H 3	maa

man willingly Submitted himSelf to her care and she performed her promiSe. He is now living to testify the truth of this • and So is the perSon that cured him, at Greenwich.
But I SuppoSe you are almost weary, I . will therefore at preSent bid you adieu.

LETTER XXIII.
My dear friend, I have roved, I have wandered far from my former Subjedl, love. Yet like a priSoner confined by bounds and limifs, I run to the utmost extent and then stop; look round and wonder where I am; gaze at the objedbs that Surround me like a newborn infant, when it first Sees the glorious 'light, or a man long blinded by catai’afts recovered. But now I again return, and Subjedt mySelf to eternal all powerful love.
I have a question to aSk before I proceed. Whilst I have been diverting, at least
amusing
i	Mr. Charles Guildford. 151
amusing you with the charaDers, and folly of others, are you not at the Same time more diverted with mine ; or do you justly ridicule it.^ How must I appear in your eyes! I at first acquainted you with thoSe excellent moral rules my father So often inculcated to me, for my future conduct in life, and the many cautions he has given me never to expoSe the follies of others tec. But who can I blame ? You for requesting me to adl thus ? or I	mySelf for complying wsith that request ?
:	I will blame neither at preSent, and for
I	this reaSon; When you desired me to
give you the characters of Some of my acquaintance in life, certain arguments you then made uSe of, convinced me; that in complying I should not da 'wrong, 1 hope the Same arguments may still be made uSe of in my favour.
If I have Set forth the charadters of Some few perSons, under fiffitious names and in a ludicrous strain, yet it was not with any malicious design. They that apply any of the characters here given, (bad ones I mean,) confeSs th mSelves guilty.* Thole that are conScious of their innocence wsill approve it. No Scandal is intended to be thrown on any Society or body of men, H 4	but
152 M E M O I R S of
but Some individuals of each are Sensible of the truth of what is here asserted. How-, ever I must now return to my own affairs.
The time for my departure for France, drew nigh; Charlotte knew it, my eyes (though my tongue was silent,) pkinly told her the Situation oS my heart, and how much I dreaded a Separation. Tho" Mr. Honor continued firm to his former resolution of accompanying me, and taking Mrs. Honor with him; yet on the proSpedl of leaving my native shore, and being Seperated So far distant not only from my parents, friends, and all I held dear in my liSe, my worthy friend and my Sister excepted: but to be Separated from the preSence of Charlotte gave me a prodigious pain, I grew melancholy, and ' w'as in a very uneaSy situation.
Company grew irkSome; diversions I had no taste for; nothing pleaSed me when abSent from Charlotte. I was ordered silence, but I learnt the language of the eyes, how easily learnt by lovers. 1 hat 1 had learnt was very evident, Charlotte observed it, and Seemed pleaSed with my conduD: I mean becaufe I had laid my tongue under restridions, I had reSolved Sooner to conlume in silence,
than
Mr. Charl es Guildford. 153
than offend with the lauguage of my tongue. I remembred the conditions on which I enjoyed the preSent bleshng, and was unwilling to forfeit it, by my own miS-condu6l.
My uneaSineSs increaSed, and became visible to the tender Charlotte, who Seemed to pity me. This gave me courage, as I fondly hoped, it would be an intro-diKstion to the passion, with which I my-Self was inSpired.
In a conversation I had with her before my departure, 1 Set forth in very pathetic terms the regret with which 1 should leave my native country, my diScourfe was ex-.	preshve of my meaning though delivered
in the most modest and reSpedful manner. The generous Charlotte, unwilling to give me pain rebuked me not; nor Seemed to understand my real meaning; but Sympathised with me in the most tender manner, and when the Scene became too moving, wiSely turned the diScourSe to Some other Subjedt.	' ,
My Sister had mentioned my uneasineSs, to Charlotte, who had affured her that she had observed it, and Sincerely Sympathised with me, for that my regret muSt neceffa-rily be great at parting with all that was H 5	dear
154 M E M O I R of
dear to me (my Sister and Mr. Honor excepted) for a considerable time at least, and that time very uncertain ; and that I must likewise be SenSible of the necessity of Soon loosing the company of thoSe two friends that intended to go with me part of the way.
“ His heart. Says she is generous and “ full of tender Sentiments. He loves -*• his country and his friends, with “ the most tender affedlion, and his Sor-“ row at parting with them, must be very great.
Ofate!” Said she, with a sigh, ’’how “ cruel!—How blind, and inconsistent “ is fortune !—Merit So conSpicuous and “ not discerned by that hood-winked god-“ deSs!—ExcuSe me my dear Lucy; em-	'
“ bracing her, the starting tear appearing “ in her eyes, I love,—I tenderly love “ your brother.—I can no longer conceal “ it.”
You remember ShakeSpear’s description of concealed love my friend, where Viola giving the history of her own 'love to the Duke Says,	1

' “ Feed on her damalk cheek, she pined “ inthoiight,'
“ And with a green‘and yellow melan-“ choly.
She Sat like patience on a monument,
“ Smiling at grief.
This is I think Somewhat applicable in the p'reSent caSe. Chaidotte, would not have discovered her’s unleSs to a generous purpoSr. But to return to Charlotte’s conversation she proceeded and Said, “ I have really loved “ him a considerable time. The deScrip-tion you had often given me of him, charmed me, and I from thence enter-tained a very great regard for him be-“ fore I Saw him. This raiSed my curio-“Tity, and I was desirous of conversing “ with him, but could not mention it, “ fearing yOu might think me guilty of an unpardonable folly.

We had genteel lodgings at Paris, Mr. Honor was acquainted with many of the French nobility, and people of falhion. The manners customs, &c. of the French are well known, I need not deScribe them to you.
The Sovereignty, with an abSolute power Seems to be vested in their king, wlia is their Sole lord; and he can whenever he pleaSes; command I may Say the lives and fortunes of his Subjedis, which are entirely in his hands. I will not Say he is So absolute as the grand Seignor i. e. the king must not adl in So open a manner as the Sultan, but yet the king of France and his ministers can find means to command the lives of any they pleafe to take. ’ How dangerous, how precarious is their Situation, when under the dominion of an unjust and cruel prince!
How excellent, and how far preferable to this is the English constitution, and the preSent form of government! How valuable, in Such a country, is a true patriot ! The English were ever esteemed a people, jealous in the highest degrqe of

During our residence in France, which v/as for a considerable time, we made fe-1	veral parties of pleaSure, which were ra-

'	What a palace will Verfailles be, when
finished! How many royal palaces are there in France! Why can not the English monarch, rival his neighbouring brother, in grand and magnificent palaces, and fuperb buildings ?

With this palace the Tuilliries has a communication. The latter is a beautiful palace. It is joined to the former by a gallery built by Henry the fourth. It tronts the river, and is esteemed th.e finest piece of its kind, of any in Europe. This gallery is about four hundred and fifty yards in length, and ten in breadth, is adorned with exquisite paintings, and pieces of Sculpture, &c.
There,is a sine palace at St. Germain, another at Fontainbleau, and Several others belonging to the French monarch. j-Fhe Canals of Briare and Orleans open a communication between the Seine and the Loire, whereby Paris is furnished v:ith the productions of the interior parts of the kingdom; and a reciprocal traffic carried on between the northern and Southern provinces
There are many exquisite paintings, in - and about Paris. ThoSe in the palace of St. Germain’s are exquisste. In the gallery that joins the Tuilleries and the Louvre, are many fine paintings, which re- . preSent the chief cities in Europe. The principal staircaSe in the palace of Versailles, confists of the finest marble, is abo>/e ten yards wide, and is beautified with admirable

&c.
In the cabinet of rarities are Several paintings by the greatest masters. The cieling of the chapel is enriched with most exquisite paintings. There is a gallery and Salon in the royal palace belonging to the duke of Orleans, at St. Cloud about two leagues West of Paris, painted by Mig-nard and very much admired.
There are Several good paintings left in the Louvre. There are apartments under the gallery mentioned before, for all Sorts of ingenious artificers, who are employed by the king. The gallery'of the palace Royal in Paris is filled with the pidures of the most illustrious perSonages of France, drawn by the greatest masters.
I think it is either the palace of Lux-1	emburg or Orleans in Paris, that hath in

Excellent examples for England to follow. The galleries of the palace of Fon-fainbleau are filled with excellent paintings, and many of the ceilings are painted by the most celebrated, Italian masters. Rut Versailles is the place which pleaSes me most. I have lately been over to take another view of it, but of that more hereafter.
I have been pretty particular, I think • in my relation of what I Saw in Paris, &c.
I must not be So particular, concerning every place of note I visited during my travels, otherwise I shall grow teeiious, and disagreeable, instead of giving you pleaSure. After staying Sometime at Paris, I very unwillingly took leave of my worthy friend and my Sister, and Set out attended by honest Truman for Rome.
I think the particulars of a journey, being difierent items of where the traveller dines. Sups, &c. is far from being agreeable, unleSs I had met with Something merry to have diverted you. Such things therefore I shall omit, and in my next give you a short^account of Some things I law, that were really curious and worihy of observation, in Some of the most remarkable places through which I travelled

But to my promiSe, of Some few things I noticed mr was acquainted with in my travels as far as Rome. The choir of the church of St. Nizier, in Lyons is adorned with excellent paintings, which exhibit to the observer’s eye the history of our Saviour.
The paintings in the Town-houSe or Guild-hall are exquiSite; particularly thoSe of the grand stair-caSe, where Lyons is re-' presented in flames. At Orange near' Dauphine is a triumphal arch almost entire, SuppoSed to have been eredted by Marias when the Romans poffeffed that city; it is curioufly painted with the representation of divers fkirmishes on horle-back.

The cathedral of Milan is a rich and - beautiful piece of antient building, in v/hich there is great variety of curious, costly workmanship; and many valuable things belonging to it. There is the Ambrosian library in Milan, famous for it’s curious manuscripts, particularly one of JoSephus in Latin, and another of the famous Leonardo da Vinci. It contains many curious designs in mechanicks and particularly in engineering.
. Lewes Sforza, sirnamed the Moor, Duke of Milan, called Leonardo, who was famous for his knowledge of the literal arts and Sciences, but particularly architecture and painting to his court, and appointed him a pension of five hundred crowns.
Leonardo, by the Duke’s desire, entered himfelf a member of the academy, that prince had just before established for architecture. This proved of the greatest benefit, to the academy. He banished the old Gothic fashions, and reduced every thing to the happy Simplicity and purity of the ancient Greeks and Romans, The Canal called MorteSena which Supplies the city of Milan with water, is above two hundred miles in length, and
is

is navigable throughout. It passes thro* the Vatteline, and the valley of Chiaven-na, condudling the waters of the rivet*
Adda, to the very walls of Milan; and enriches both the city and the adjacent campaign wdth the Po and the Sea.
This was designed by the Same Prince, and the execution of it committed to Le-, onardo. It was a noble and difficult en-terprize, every way worthy of Leonardo’s genius, and by that great master executed accordingly. Our Lord’s Supper, which he, by the Duke’s order, painted for the refedlory of the Dominicans of St.
Maria delle Gratie, is an excellent piece,
•	and reckoned Leonardo’s master-piece.
I	There is a copy of this painting, at Stv
Germain in France, took by the order of Francis the first, who would have re*> moved the original to France, but that it was impraisticable, the history being painted, on a thick wall, and taking up no leSs than thirty Square feet in area. The original is now imperceptible, the moisture having diluted the colours it being painted, in oil; for the wall was not Sufficiently Secured from moisture and dampneSs.
What a pity that this noble Duke should be engaged in an unhappy war. He I 4	was

was taken priSoner, and carried to France where he died in the castle of Loches.
On this the academy was destroyed, the professors turned adrift, and the art effec-	i
tually banished out of Milan.
Italy gained by theSe misfortunes of the MilaneSe, for Leonardo’s School being broke up, the Scholars Spread them-Selves over the whole country. He had made painters, carvers, architedls, founders, and engravers in crystal and precious stones, &c.
Out of his School came, Francis Mebzi,
CeSar Sesto, Bernard Lovino, Andrew Salaino, mark Uggioni, Anthony Bal-trassio, Gobbo an extraordinary painter.	f
and carver, Annibal Fontana a worker in ’	1
marble and precious stones; Bernazzano	I
an excellent painter of landshapes, Paul	I
Lomazzo, and Several others. I could fill a volume in the praiSes of Leonardo ■ who is my greatest favourite.
He was invited by Francis the first to France when he was old, he languished lometime at Fontainbleau, and that noble prince one day visiting him, he to shew liis SenSe of the lavour, railed himSelf on his bed; at that instant he was Seized with a fainting fit, Francis stooping to

There is another piece v/rote by Leonardo, in the Ambrosian library, being a treatiSe on lights and shadows. Leonardo wrote thirteen treatiSes, but.they are diSperSed in different places. Before 1 take leave of Leonardo da Vinci I think it v/ill not be amiSs if I give you a relation of two particular circumstances, taken from the history of his life, prefixed to his treatiSe of painting, a curious piece a translation of which was published in London in 1721: which are theSe.
In the year 1503, the Florentines re-Solving to have thest council chamber ■painted, Leonardo, by a public decree 'was elected to that performance. He had 'made a considerable progreSs in one side of the chamber, when he had the mortification to find that his colours did not stick, but as fast asthey dried they looSeneei from the wall. Michael Angelo, in concurrence with Leonardo, painted another side of the room; Michael though he was but a young man, yet he was become a very able painter; and had at that time acquiredi a very great reputation : inSo-much that at 29 years of age he v/as not I 3	afraid

afraid to vie with Vinci who was sixty.
Each had his friends and. partizans, who far from bringing them to a better understanding, helped the more to embitter	'
them against each other; So that Michael and Leonardo commenced open enemies.
About this time Raphael coming fresh out of Perugino’s School, was led by Le*	|
onardo’s reputation to Florence ; the first	i
view of Vinci’s works struck him with	■
astonishment, and wrought a reformation '	,
in him, to which all the glory he has	j
since acquired, may be justly aferibed.
He began now to look upon the dry,	|
harsh manner of his old master Perugiao	i
with contempt; and to Set before him	1
the tenderneSs and delicacy of Leonardo	j
for his imitation; and with Such incredi-	'
ble vigour, as well as SucceSs, did he fob	'
low his new master; that he arrived by degrees at the utmost pinnacle of his art; and to this day, for the SoftneSs and Iweet-neSs of his figures, reigns. abSolute and without rival.
You will not be leSs pleaSed with Leonardo's charadler, therefore from the Same	1
author I will give you a Iketch of it, that	!
you may love him as a great man, as well as I do.

He died at the age of 75, extremely regretted by all that knew him, or who loved the polite arts, honoured with the friendship and esteem of a mighty King. Nature perhaps never was more lavish, than in the compoSure of this great man, for she gave him even all that she had.
He was extremely handSome and well shaped, his strength was Surprizing and he acquitted himSelf with uncommon ap-plauSe in all exerciSes of the body. But the talents of his mind were still more extraordinary than thoSe of his perSon ; he joined to a polite behaviour, the greatest strength and elevation of mind : a Surprizing vivacity, to an unwearied application to study; a good stock of learning to a pleasing converlation. He refrained from marriage that he might work with , the more freedom; on which occasion one of his friends Said that Leonardo would marry no mistreSs but painting, nor beget any children but the works he performed.
So far 'from the author who wrote his life, but now, as I am upon a darling theme, permit me to give you a few ex-tradls from the tranfiators preface whoSc? language, and Sentiments &c. will greatly pleale you.

"Tis not in painting alone, but in philo-» Sophy too, that Leonardo has Surpassed all his brethren of the pencil; nor does it appear In the least improbable, but that ^twas his uncommon shill in the latter, to which, in great meaSure, he owed his Surprising SucceSs in the former. The truth is, theSe are two faculties, that may be nearer a kin, than every one, perhaps is aware of; nor would there be any thing, methinks, very daring in the aS-Sertion should I affirm, that philoSophy is absolutely necessary, byway of preliminary to painting. To paint, his allowed is to imitate nature: But, is not the Knowledge of nature, evidently requisite to the Imitation thereof ? And must it not be pleafant, to fee men about to represent natural objedts, who are unacquainted with the nature and properties • of the objedls to be represented ! Quacks indeed there may be in painting as well as'in other professions, but to become

The example and SucceSs of Leonardo, cannot fail. Sure, to animate our painters to the study of philoSophy and mathematics, If this great master could turn the old philoSophy of his'age to So^ good an account in painting, what might not be expedted from the System of nature, as it stands under its preSent improvements by the moderns ? We fee what laudable uSes he makes, even of a defec- ' tive dodlrine of light: to what a pitch would he have carried his art, had he been acquainted with the new, the noble the Newtonian theory of light and colours, what improvements would not he have made, had the diScoyeries of a Ba-_ ,I si	con

anSwer it, if their art should Seem to decline, at a time when the knowledge of nature and of Geometry which are the very basis whereon it is built is So wonderfully improved : but this I dare venture to pronounce, that they will never reach Leonardo in painting, till they have	^
first rival’d him in philoSophy.	’
But it is time to return to myTotmer Subjeft. I shall therefore proceed in giving you an account of Some other curious pieces of art, &c. I Saw in the couisie of my travels, and for that purpofe I now remove my Scene, from Milan to Parma.
The cupola of the cathedral of Parma	*
is beautifully painted, and by an excel-lent hand. I believe it was done by Cor-regio.
The church of St. John is exquisitely painted, and beautifully adorned ’vvith curious workmanship, &c.
The duke’s palace, is a noble and an elegant strudlure. The gallery of the theatre is hung with a great number of pi^lures, all executed by celebrated maS-iters.
.At
(
Mr. Charles Guildford. i8i
At Modena, the apartments of the duke’s palace are adorned with paintings, by the best masters.
, At Bologna in the halls of the mar-quiSs Rinucci are Several curious large paintings, &c. and the apartments adjoining to the halls are furnished with exquisite paintings.
The legates palace is famous for the cabinet of Aldrovandus, in which (among other things are Several hundred large ma-nuScripts of his own writing, fifteen whereof are filled with the figures of birds, beasts, fishes, and plants all illustrated with their natural colours.
The church of Saint Paul is remarkable for its fine paintings, on the roof and on the dome ; and Several piDures of the life of St. Paul done by a masterly hand, over the Seats of the monks. At St, Gio-voni del Monte, in Bologna, is an admirable picture of St. Cecilia with an instrument of muSick in her hands : on one fide of her are the figures of St. John and St. Paul; and on the other Mary Mag-delen and Sr. Austen. This is a master-peice of the famous Raphael, and is el-teemed one of the greatest treafures of the city.
In
i82 M E M O I R S of
In the church of the Dominican’s is a tomb of St. Dominic, over which is an excellent picfture of the Saint, done by that great master Guido Rheni. The church of the mendicants alSo, abounds with excellent paintings; of which the most beautiful pieces, are the calling of St. Matthew and a dead Christ.
In the convent of St. Michael in BoSco near Bologna, there is a piazza painted in FreSco, but it is much decayed. The ' rooms, See. of the public Schools in Bologna, are adorned with admirable paintings, See. In short, Bologna abounds with fine paintings. The duke of Florence in his new palace called Pitti; hath many exquisite paintings, with which his apartments are adorned; but the famous gallery of the old palace, is furniSned with the best colleDion of pictures and statues in the world.
The Domo or Cathedral in Florence called Santa Maria Florida, hath exqui» site paintings, on the cupola, and altar.
See. The collegiate church of St. Lawrence is adorned with excellent paintings,
&c. But the chapel adjoining to it of	'
the lame name, the burial place of the Medician family, is the finest, and most
costly
Mr. Charles Guildford. i8f
costly piece of work, on the face of the earth.
There is alSo a famous library belonging to the convent of St. Lawrence. The disorders of Lombardy, and the misfortunes of his antient patrons -the Sforzi, obliging Leonardo da Vinci to quit Milan, he retired to Florence, which might be called the place of his nativity, for he was born in the castle of Vinci, situate in the valley of Arno, a pleaSant place, a little below Florence,
During his residence there, he painted Several fine pieces. The principal piece on which he bestowed the most pains, and in which he took the greatest pleaSure, > was the pidlure of LsiSa commonly called la Joconde. This was a divine piece ; Francis the first was So charmed with it,, that he purchaSed it at the price of four thouSand crowns; and it is still to be Seen in his Successors cabinet.
This work cost Leonardo four entire years, and yet is Said to be left unfinish’cL. While he was employed in painting this. ' lady, he had musicians constantly attending; always playing upon instruments,, or Singing with their voices to divert her,, and to prevent her from shewing a certain
indolence
i
i84 MEMOIRS of
indolence and melancholy which people out of adlion are extremely liable to,
• About the fame time he painted and finished Several other valuable pidlures, the one a nobleman of Mantua, and an other a daughter of Americus Benci, much admired in thoSe days for her incomparable beauty. He alSo finished a Flora about the fame time, which is still to be Seen in Paris.-
Leonardo continued at Florence, till . the year 1513. The most considerable of his works at that time, were a piece representing the virgin with her little Son ; and a Baptist’s head; the one now in the possession of the Botto, and the other in thoSe of Caniello Albizzi.
Once more I leave my favourite painter but it is now in the arms of death, and with him Heave Florence, the occasion of mentioning him a Second tim.e. Now to PiSa, I shall only mention the cathedral of this place dedicated to the blessed Virgin aid called St, Mary. The choir of this church is painted by the most famous masters, and is exquifitely well done.
I staid Sometime at Leghorn to obServc the manners, dreSs, customs. See. of the different people that came from almost all
parts

parts of the world to that city. Leghorn is I think the best place in Italy for meet-i! ■ ing with foreigners from almost all nations, but more especially from Turkey. Making my observation on mankind in this city engaged my attention too much, to enquire what curious paintings or pieces of architedlure, performed by famous I	masters were there; So that I obServed no-
thing of that kind worth observation, excepting one church, I happened by chance 'to notice which was a pretty piece of ar-chitedlure, and adorned with Some good I	paintings &c. but I have forgot the name
I	of it, however it is not material.
I	And now for Sienna. In the library be-
I	longing 10 the cathedral of that place, the
great adlions of Pius the Second, are admirably well painted. The colours Seem not at all faded, though stwas done above three hundred years ago.. Foreigners that learn Italian, uSually stay at Sienna for that purpoSe, where the Italian language is Spoke and taught, in its greatest purity.

The church of St. John de Lateran is ' the metropolitan church of Rome, tho’ its far inferior to St. Peters.
It was built by Constantine as was old St. Peters.
On the altar of St. Stephen, in the church of St. Paul about a mile from. Rome, is a beautiful pidture representing the stoning of St. Stephen, done by the ingenious I avinia Fontana.
The chapel of Sixtus the fifth, is justly admired for its excellent paintings, &c. Here is the last judgment done by Michael Angelo. This chapel joins to the great hail, or Sala Regia, in the Vatican, of which I shall preSently take more particular notice.
The churches in general in Rome are curious pieces of ArchiteDure, and are adorned with good paintings. Sculptures See. and other curious workmanship.
I have mentioned Some of their relicks ’ds needleSs, and would be a fruitleSs labour to enumerate every particular, I canst, nor would it be entertaining: I fiiall therfore paSs to his hoiineSs’s palaces, and from thence to the palaces of Some of the principal families at Rome.

I hope this short account will prove Sa^ tisfadlory. Let us vary the Subjedl. 1 observed that agreat part of the land in Italy lay uncultivated. This is I believe occasioned by the heavy tax laid upon corn.
So that the poorer land will not r^iSe crop Sufficient to pay the dluties, &c. together with the necestary expence attending it.
Hwas happy for England luch a tax has not been been impoSed. Italy is but thinly peopled ; occasioned by So great a number of both Sexes being tied up by vows of' chastity from propagating their Species.
• The country in general may be Said to be poor (their churches, &c. excepted) and that poverty proceeds from So many lusty young people being shut up in cloiS-ters, &c. and not increasing the wealth of the public by their labour and industry.
The avarice of Some of the pope’s is another occasion of the poverty of the people.

From Rome, my dear friend, I beg leave to conduft' you to Venice. SuppoSe yourSelf on the Rialto. This is the principal bridge, over the grarai canal in Venice.
It is esteemed one of the finest in Europe. It consists of one Single arch, all of marble, has rails on each fide, and tv:o rows of shops in the middle. Oshe compals of the arch is one third part of a circle, the width of it oil the level of the water, from one extremity to the other, is ninety-five feet, and theheighth twenty-four.
It was designed by the celebrated Michael Angelo. H'w^as built in the year 1591. The building of this famous bridge cost 250,000 ducates. In the Doge’s palace at Venice is the chamber of the college, in which is painted Jupiter darting his thunder; an admirable perforntance done by the famous Paul Veronefe.
But the great council chamber exceeds all the rest, for its exquisite paintings done by Paul VeroneSe, and Tinto-

ret, who Seem here to have exerciSed their utmost IkilL The principal pieces are the .battles of the Venetians, the siege of Constantinople, the history of pope Alex^ ander the third, treading on the neck of the Emperor Frederick BarbaroSa, and a representation of Paradife, very much admired by the nicest judges.
In the refedtory ot the convent of the benedidlines, on a little iSland opposite to the Square of St. Mark, is a representation of the lords Supper, painted by Paul Veronese, and is one of the most cele^ brated pieces in the city.
The church della Salute is adorned with exquisite paintings. The Venetians especially the nobility, in the furniture of their palaces have a greater number of paintings than any other city in Europe, done by the best masters. Such as Titian, Paul VeroneSe, and Tintoret. The last is more esteemed at Venice than elSewhere ' in Italy.
Several fine pieces of his are to be Seen' in the Scuola St. Rocco, or School of St. Roch; particularly a picture of the Annunciation, which is reckoned extremely valuable on account of the lively exprel-Sion of Surprize, admiration and joy, that K 5	'	app ar

I have not mentioned Naples yet; which is by all esteemed the garden of Italy. His great pity VeSuvius, that famous dreadful Volcano is So near to it. .Dis but about eight miles distant. It lies eastward. The churches in Naples are remarkable for their fine paintings, his needleSs therefore to mention them more particularly excepting the church belonging to the convent of the Carthusians, near the castle of St. Elmo in this city, which hath, among many other fine paintings, the nativity of Christ by Guido, and Several pidlures of the Lords Supper done by the greatest masters.
The church of Loretto about three miles from the Adriatic Sea or gulf of Venice, is adorned with excellent paint-' ings, and is poffeffed of an immenSe quantity of riches. In this church is encloSed the holy houfe Said to be brought by Angels from Jerusalem, to Some other place and Some lime afterwards removed again by angels from thence, and put down in the place where it now stands.

The church belonging to the Carmelites, is justly admired for its exquisite paintings. Ferrara is Situated near the Po, which is the finest river in. Italy.
The church of St. Anthony in Padua -'which is Subjedl to the Venetians, is adorned with excellent paintings. Sculpture, &c. The church oS St. Justina in Padua was designed bythe famous Palladio. Over the high altar hangs an exquisite piece of painting done by Paul VeroneSe, representing the martyrdom of the Saint to whom the church is dedicated. I liked Venice extremely'well and therefore continued there Some considerable time.
This city is extremely pleaSant and a-greeable, and the many diversions I found there gave me very great entertainment.
I copied Several pieces of Tintoret’s and Paul VeroneSe &c. during my stay there, and took a draught of the Rialto and of the Doge’s palace. I alSo copied Several _ pieces and took Several draughts in Rome and otjier places where my stay had given me an opportunity.

This gave me Some Satisfadlion as I was ‘in hopes my parents love and tenderneSs for me with the very great expences they had been at, had not been bestowed on a Soil entirely barren.
But the thoughts of Charlotte my dear friend often gave me pain. The high SenSe she entertained of her duty charmed me ; but the miSery she Suffered on that account, was the Subject of great uneaSi-neSs to me.
This alone was Sufficient to cut off all my hopes. The conSent of her parents must be gained. I had neither birth nor fortune to recomm.end me. England was still dear to me, notwitstanding I had little to expedl from it.
I had long deSigned to take a view of that other famous Volcano mount .Dtna, in the issand of Sicily. I thought I might as well take shipping at Venice, and Sail down the gulf, to the issand of Sicilly, where after having taken a curSory view of mount iEtna, and what other things I

WH E N I had taken leave of my friends at Venice, I embarked on board a ship bound for the ifiand of Si^
‘cily, accompanied by honest Truman.
We Sailed down the gulf, and were just got out into the open Sea; when a Turk-ilb vessel came up, and clapped us aboard.
A Smart engagement enSued, and we fought like delperate people; who were rather reSolved on death than ssavery:
-	however
2o6 M E M O I R S of
.r	however it was to little purpoSe, and only
Served to enrage the Turks, which made them afterwards treat us more barbaroussy than they otherwiSe would have done.
We were obliged to Surrender. They took great part of us on board their ship, . and put, us in Irons, where we were left to bemoan our wretched fate. The rest of the prisoners were left on board the Nenetian ship with a Sufficient number of hands to guard them.
We continued Some time on the Seas, and at length were carried up the gulf of Saloniki. We were Soon after put on shore at Saloniki where we were carried to the Bazar, or market-place and expoSed to Sale like So many beaSts.
Trueman and mySclf were purchaSed by a well dreffed, elderly tu.'k, after he had ashed Some questions concerning us, and taken a thorough Survey of our perSons &c. IdoneSt Trueman was extremely glad we were both purchaSed by one maS-ter, for I believe the poor fellow dreaded, not even stavery more, than he did a Separation.
We were, by our new master carried to a handSome, genteel houSe, in Saloniki; were we remained for Several days, without
^r..DHARLES Guildford. 207
without knowing for what we vTre designed, not then being put to any Sort of labour.
Haley, (themame of our master) Spoke a Sort of barbarous English, but plain enough to be understood. He ashed me many questions in relation to my education, profession, See. and at length begged me to give him a full account of my life'.
He had behaved very well to me. I could not refuSe to comply with his request, and therefore Satis Bed him in every particular, to the best of my remembrance. He leemed pleaSed with my in-genuouSneSs, and the Sincerity with which I had made the relation.
He then told me, that I must not look upon him as my master; for that he had only bought m-", for the uSe of a veiy worthy young man for whom he was a Ibrt of fadtor there. That he re Sided up in the inland parts, at Sophia, and then lay dangeroussy ill there.
The generous Turk behaved in the most friendly manner to us, treating us rather like companions than Oaves. When I hinted my fear of being Separated from ' 7'rueman, who* had been a foster-father to me and attended me from my infancy, he
kindly
■ 208	M E M O I R S of
kindly informed me that his power ex* tended So far as that he could and would assure me, we needed not to dread any Such thing. He endeavoured all he possibly could to lighten our chains, and to make us eaSy under our afflidlion.
We at length Set out from Saloniki; for Sophia, where our master resided. When we arrived at his houSe, Haley went up to OSman (for that was the name of our maS-ter,) and after staying Some time with him came down and took me up to him.
OSman aSked me Several questions in regard to my Skill in physic. I acquainted him with what I had studied, viz. Botany : and that I had learnt Some valuable Secrets in physic of a particular friend : but that stwas a Science I had not studied in order to profeSs, but for the preSent preservation of my own health.
He complimented me, by affuring me, that as I Spoke So modestly of my abilities he doubted not my fkill and that he would " trust himSelf entirely to my care for his cure, if he was curable. I told him I would not attempt to promiSe him SucceSs but that I would endeavour to the utmost of my power to Serve him.

I prescribed my patient a regimen with a proper diet. I \vas furnished with every	^
thing necessary and requisite for the pur-poSe. I extradled the juices of Several So-poriferous herbs which when mixed with others of a strong nature, 1 administred to him. This at the Same time that it gave	i
him that rest which he very much wanted, cleanSed his body, from thoSe vicious humours it had contradled, purging his blood and refining it; whilst it diSperSed the eledtric fire equally through all parts, and brought his body into a proper order, for the reception of Some balSamics and tindlures which I afterwards prepared for hicn.
TheSe cherished the vital parts, and the vicious humours being before purged off,	,
the medicines I gave him met not with any oppoSition to obstrutft the force of its operations, or overpower its virtues. My patient Soon felt the effedls of my advice, and preScriptians; and thoSe that knew him, WTre very much Surprized at the great alteration they Saw in him.

OSman was extremely grateful and very generous to mie on occasion of the Service I had done him.
Trueman had been from my first arrival at Sophia, by the generous OSman destined to attend on me as uSual; and OSman daily gave me Some mark of his favour. He could talk English pretty well; having from his infancy been ac-’ customed to converSe with English chrif-' tians.^
He had promiSed me my freedom and that he would handSomely reward me, if I performed the desired cure. He performed his promiS^ and im.mediately on his recovery, made me and Trueman free, gave me jewels, precious stones, money, &c. to the value of above one thouSand pounds English stirling money, together ;	with a valuable diamond ring from his
own finger, worth two hundred guineas, all which he insisted on my receiving, not being much to him, as he w'as poffcffed of immenSe riches.

Lie was poffeSSed of excellent virtues, and his notions of things with his adions, in general, were founded on the stridest rules of real honour, juS-tice, and probity.
He was a generous, humane, worthy, man ; far excelling many Christians who are esteemed good, and was little inferior to any. His greatest faults vrere owing to youth undireded, and not to bad principles. Being ready for my departure, fie Seemed uneaSy, and begged me to continue Sometimie with him, faying as he had a very great friendship and regard for me, he knew not how at that time to bear a Separation.

LETTER XXX.
IM U S 0’ drop my former Subjedl, that I may acquaint you with things as they happened, tho’ not as I knew them.
Charlotte as I afterwards learnt, was now if possible grown far more beautiSul. ss-ler fortune which before was great, was increased by Several large legacies, which were left her.
So much beauty with Such a very expensive fortune attradled many admirers.
’ .Among the many that paid their addresses
. to Charlotte, was lord L--------a youQg
Scottish nobleman of an ancient,and honourable family. His fortune was not very large, but in regard to perSonal merit, he was possessed of every accomplish-.ment, every qualification requisite to render the marriage state happy.
Mr. Worthy approved of-this young, nobleman, and as Charlotte could not make any objedlion to him ; he insisted ' . on her receiving his addresses, and that she would esteem him -as the man he designed for her future Hushand.
' This was a hard injundlon to Charlotte and one that she could not well obey
without
214 M E M O I R S of
without doing a very great violence to her Self. But she had made it an established rule never to let her affections carry her to any action beyond the bounds of duty, and as her father (who was in other reSpects a tender and affeCbionate parent,) insisted on her admitting the addresses of lord L.-----could she refuSe ?
No, she reSolved to obey, tho’ death was the confequence. W'hat an unparalleled instance of filial duty !
But are there not duties owing from the parent to the child? and great ones too ? there certainly are, but yet the nonperformance of the parents, will not ex- ■ CLiSe any negleCl or diSobedience in a child in many instances.
A child is in duty bound to obey the lawful commands of a parent,' though the parent doth not perform the duties incumbent on him. But on Such an occasion, as is before mentioned, all laws divine and human leave the child at freedom.
In regard to their affeClions, and chuSing if prudent, the courSe they intend to steer in future life, there I think they ought to be left inti rely free.

He may by his pru-dentadvicediredlhis child in the choice of a companion for life, but if the affections are already engaged, his authority immediately ceaSes, and he has no longer a power in that reSpedt.
Lord L-------by the fathers conSent,
paid his addresses to Charlotte, who according to her former resolution Summit-ted.
• The writings were drawn, Settlements prepared, and every thing was Soon got ready for the Sacrifice of the charming maid.
O how many bitter sighs, how many precious tears did it cost the lovely mourner. Her preparations were not like thoSe of a joyous bride, but far different.
Grief and Sorrow Sat painted in her countenance, notwithstanding all her endeavours to diSpel the gloom. Nothing but the melancholly Ideas of a miSerable life filled her mind. Her onlyOiope was that it would be but short. What a Sacrifice to duty, cruel duty 1

The day was fixed, and the hour drew nigh, wherein the fair Charlotte was to Surrender herSelf up a Sacrifice to the man she could not love, as a proof of her duty.
She had Several times requested her father to permit her to continue in a single state, as she did not desire to change her condition in life ; but no, he refuSed and insisted on her cornpliance. Charlotte could only grieve in Silence and beg relief from heaven, which just before the appointed day, unexpedtedly arrived, though not in the manner she desired.
Lord L.------had received a fall from his
horSe, the conSequences of which were a violent contusion in his head, and an inward bruiSe from a blow he received in his fall on his stomach.
He lay dangeroussy ill for a considerable time, and no one expeded his recovery.
Charlotte was not So inhuman as to rejoice at the melancholy occasion of the nuptials being deferred, but greatly pitied the miserable fufSerer.
His lordship at length grew better and his health began to be established, when venturing out too Soon to visit his mistreSs
before
Mr. Charles Guildford. 217
before the wound in his head was entirely cured, he got a violent cold, the wound broke out a fresh, his stoisiach was not yet recovered, a fever enSued ; and in a very short time he Sunk under the weight of his diSeaSes, to the very great grief of all that knew him, even the tender Charlotte, who was thereby releafed from the nuptials she So much dreaded, let fall a gentle tear on the occasion, and greatly pitied his unhappy Sate.
She now hoped for freedom, but how
short was the reSpite lord L-----’s death
o;ave the fair Sufferer. It Soon beinor
O	O
known that Charlotte was free from her
former engagements, the earl of C--------
by Mr. Worthy’s permission paid his addresses to Charlotte, on whom the father as before, laid the cruel injunction to admit the earl’s addresses.
The earl’s fortune was not very extensive, but to this Mr. Worthy made no objection, as he was of an antient and lionourable family, and possessed of every perlonal accomplishment requisite to com-pleat the sine gentleman.
The earl was a man of real worth and honor, and as Such behaved in all hL actions. He was as a lover assiduous in VoL. I.	L	his
2i8 M E M O I R S of
his attendance on Charlotte. Charlotte, after a Serious refiedlion on the Con-Sequences oS putting in execution a stsheme Site had long intended to put in pradlice, on any emergency, now fully reSolved to compleat it.
At a private conference between the	*
earl and Charlotte, she acquainted him that her affedlions were already engaged, v/here duty bid her bestow her hand.
That she could not, if she married any other man, give her own actual free consent,, or bestow her' heart where she gave her hand; Sor which reaSon Sne Said she greatly feared the union he, in conjudlion	;
with her father, fo ardently desired, would only render them unhappy for life; but left it to his generosity and prudence to a<5t in Such a manner as lie thought pro-per.
The noble earl made Charlotte Several	j
compliments on her frankneSs, and affur-ed her, that he was So far from forcing her inclinations in his favour, when they were engaged to another, that he would assist her as much as lay in his power, and would no longer be an obstacle to her hapoineSs.
He

Mr. Charles Guildford. 219
He took his leave of Charlotte, and desired a private conference with Mr. Worthy, with whom he staid a considerable time; when he w’as gone Mr. Worthy Sent for his daughter, with whom he appeared to be greatly offended.
Charlotte endeavoured to appeaSe him ' in the most gentle manner, as she greatly feared the earl had informed him of what had pasted between them. But the earl had adted more prudently, had taken the whole upon himSelf, by affuriag the father of his mistreSs that he was Sensible that the lady had not that real affedlion for him with which he was defirous of inspiring the woman wdiom he intended ’	for his wife ; and after reafoning with
him Some time on the before mentioned point of how far a father’s authority ex-.	tends, and whether they were allowed to
force their children into the marriage state contrary to their affedlions,-&c. and Setting forth the whole in the most lively colours, he convinced the old gentleman that he had not adted entirely right, with regard to Charlotte.
Mr. Vvterthy when he had examined his daughter concerning the diSgust she had leveral times shewn to entering into ^ h	L 2	the
A'	i
i20 M E M O I R S of
the marriage state, confessed himSelf pleaf-ed with thoSe instances of filial duty, she had already given him, and affured her that for the future she should be left at liberty ro adl in tJiat rcSpedt, as she pleaS-ed ; on condition she would never debaSe ' herSelf, and dishonour her family, by marrying a perSon whoSe birth was beneath her own.
Charlotte gladly accepted liberty on thoSe terms; affured her father she would at all times readily obey his commands; ithat she would never marry without his conSent, and approbation; and made him the most grateful acknowledgements for the favour he had conSerred on her. Charlotte was now, in comparison to her late condition, happy. She no longer dreaded being forced to marry the man {he did not love, notwithstanding she was debarred frorn having the man on whom her affedlions were placed.
Several Gentlemen of birth and fortune applied to Mr. Worthy for permission to pay their addreSfes to his daughter, but he, like a man of real honour, continued firm to his promiSe, and affured Such as applied to him, that he had left his daughter entirely to her own choice; and

therefore their chief point must be to gain her conSent, and they would be certain of his of cosirSe.
It being left to Charlotte to give her lovers a conclusive anSvver, she Soon idismissed them from their attendance on her, as she had not the least inclination to co-quettry. How and when I received this inSorm.ation, I shall Some other iin)e ac> quaint you, and am at preSent, '	,

LETTER XXXI.
SH o R T L y after my arrrival at Sophia,
I wrote to England an account of ,	. v;hat had befallen me,' and expc(fted
an anSwer during my residence there, but none came. This made me uneaSy, as I always dreaded the worst. I was in ^	Some Sort relieved by the company and
I ^ conversiition of Olman my generous friend .	* L 3	other*
222 M E M O I R S of
o'therwiSe my life would have been by my rcfledlions rendered miferable.
OSman wms a man of excellent natural parts; very humane and very generous.
His principles were chiefly good and noble, but the luxury in which he had been bred up, had very much debauched him.
His father, who was then dead, was in his life a man of great note, in the Grand ' Seignor's court. He uSed often to be at the Porte, ’and there was Scarce a Divan of any conSequence held, but lie was prefent at it.
He at length obtained for the many Services he had performed for the Grand Seignor, the government of a very large province, which was a very imiportant trust ; and which during his life-time he executed with great honour, justice, and integrity.
OSman being the only child his father had, though he had, (according to the custom of the turks,) Several wives'; was indulged in every tiling he desired, and being left entirely to his own will when he grew up to years of maturity, his inclinations led him to the adoration of the fair Sex, and he devoted hirnielf entirely to their Service. He turned libertine, and
his
Mr. Charles Guildford. 223
'	his inclinations and desires beii;g violent,
he purSued them v/ithout alloy.
His fortune being ImmenSe, he gave himSelf almost wholly up to a debauched life, -which brought that complication ot disorders upon him, under which he laboured when I first Saw him.
'He knev/ Something of the English tongue, as I before obl'erved, which he learnt of an English stave, a tavourite of his; whom he had, not long before, freed, and Sent home to England with a tortune to Support him. He alSo learnt of4!^s EngliSiiman Some of the principles of the •	Christian religion, 'A'hich he very much
admired and greatly commende.l : but could not So far Subdue his passions, as to follow thofe excellent moral rules he had learnt.	'
As I entertained a very great regard for this noble generous man, I uSed my utmost endeavours to teach him to Subdue his ?	passions, and to hearken to the dictates of
•	right reaSon, as alfo to give him as just an
idea of the Supreme Being, as I possibly I	could, but ot that more hereafter. His
Soul was capable of entertaining all the Social virtues ; and though he was a debauchee, yet there were in his condud Seve-;	L 4	ral
t
224 M E M O I R S of
ral things, that shev/ed he fometimet adted, or endeavoured to afl; according to the stridlest rules of honour, and juS-tice, from good and humane principles.
I therefore needed only to root out a , few weeds, that were from the liberties his religion allowed, unhappily Sprung up in a rich Soil, to enlarge his understanding, and clear that mist Vv/hich clouded his rea-Son; in order to make him vrith eaSe imbibe the principles and fundamental rules of the Christian religion.
I shewed him as well as I possibly could, according to Locke, the original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge; and explained to him the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and assent which with the arguments I made uSe of on that occasion, I thought would cure him of any unreasonable prejudices, which he might have entertained in favour of maliom.ctiSm, and other things wliich he had assented to. vfithout examining. I inculcated to him Some moral rules; explained the nature, and cauSes of many things; and then deduced the whole, from the original and first cauSe. The fundamental
Mr. Charles Guildford, 225
mental rules and principles of the Christian religion, I explained to him in the most eaSy method, and Set the whole in the clearest light I could. He at length confessed himSelf entirely converted, and gloried in the apellation of a Christian; often looking back with wonder and amazement on his former ignorance.
We applied to a Christian priest belonging to the Greek church, then at Sophia, who after examining my friend, baptized him by the name of Charles, he being reSolved to be called by my name.
When I had initiated him in the School of virtue, and led him into the roadof truth and knowledge ; I perSuaded him to travel, in order to draw off his affedlions from thoSe pleaSures, he had been already immerSed in, and prevent him trom falling again a Sacrifice to his reigning paS-sion.
He consented, on condition I would go with him as far as Galaza on the Euxine Sea, where he had Some affairs of moment to tranSadt; which had been deferred on account of his late illneSs; and that then he would not desire to detain me any longer in Turkey ; but would accompany L 5	me
, 226 M E M O I R S of ,
me to Adrionople and Constantinople, the two principal places I wanted to See, during my residence in thoSe parts.
I conSented on theSe conditions, and preparations were immediately made tor our departure. My melancholy encreaS-ed, as I could not hear from England, but the noble OSman endeavoured all he could to diSpel the gloom, and to divert my melancholy; but could not render Turkey, though in Europe So agreeable to me, as Italy: but as diSagreeable as it was, it would have been far more diSagreeable to me, had I been deprived of the company and conversation of my friend.
The people, their religion, government, laws, customs, manners, language, dreSs, &c. were So far different from what I had ever been accustomed to, that it is no wonder if it appeared diSagreeable.
A \ery great difference my fiie.id, be-, tween that, and Italy, which is reckoned the garden of the world. But an uneaSy mind rendered things far more diSagreeable than they might perhaps have appeared to a perSon entirely eaSy and free, (charlotte whoSe distressed situation I then
knew
Mr. Charl ES Guildford. 227
knew not, engaged my attention too much, to relish other pleaSures. I dreaded what miglr happen in my abSence, though now I had Scarce any hope left. But had I known how near the unhappy moment was, that would have deprived me of all my hopes, I must unavoidably have added greatly to my uneaSineSs.
TheSe things, as we purSued our journey not only to Galaza, but on our return likewise attradled my attention So far ; that I took little notice of the places through which we passed, or the cnrioSi-t es we Saw. We Set out from Sophia,^ and travelled on without stopping any considerable time until we arrived at Hi-copoli, where OSman staid Some time at a friend’s houSe.
We were very well entertained, and in a very noble manner. OSman had at length almost forgot his late Severe fit of illneSs, and was attempting the conquest of a beautiful girl belonging to his friend’s family.
I perceived it, and took an opportunity to remonstrate to him, in a cool manner; his ingratitude to that Supreme-Being who had So lately restored him to life and L 6	health
22S M E M O I R S of
health, and all its attendant blessings; and the sin he was going to commit by betraying to ruin an innocent girl, and desired him as a Christian ferioufiy to ressedt on ir.
He confessed the remonstrance just; was not offended at my freedom, and promised amendment. Women are not easily to he met with in Turkey. They con-verSe but little with men. They are therefore easily conquered, nature pleads as powerfully in them as in our Sex, and they are more capable of entertaining the tender passion. In Turkey a woman has but little time to deliberate on matters of love, and therefore t.hoSe that Surrender strike Soon.
>	For this reaSon, I esteem it a happy
deliverance, for the young lady, on whom OSman intended to try his Skill in the art of love, for she did not appear to have any diSiike to my friend, who was a very handSome man, in the prime of life, and the very fiower of his youth.
I had Scarce broke off this intrigue when I discovered that he had found means to get into his friend’s Seraglio, to a beautiful fiave he had Seen there; when
his	'
f
Mr. Charles Guildford 229
his friend, confiding in his honour, and the little inclination he could have for the fair Sex, after having Suffered So much for their Sakes, had shewed him his beauteous treaSure.
This stave had taken as great a liking * to OSman, as he had to the fair lady; OS-man had found means to convey a letter to her, wherein he had declared his paS*-Sion, and begged her to conSent to an interview. She agreed. A golden key, let my friend into her apartment, and' leve-ral times into the gardens belonging to, this little Seraglio, when she was there.
I have little reaSon to think they met without making the intended uSe of thoSe opportunities, their art and industry had given them.
' I dreaded the conSequence of this intri-gue, for I not only fetwed a difcovery but aiib a relapSe from virtue ; and that he would again run into thoSe Scenes of vice ^	and debauchery he had So lately emerged
from.	'
I was therefore from this and other circumstances, fully reSoived to remove him,
’	as Soon as poisible, from Hicapoli. The
conlequences of this reSolution I believe

I Me NT ION ED my last diScovery to OS-man who was not only greatly Surprized, but confuSed alSo and wondered by what means I had made this diScovery.
“ My dear Charles,” Says he, “ you “ must certainly have a familiar to attend on you ; that you thus know every > “ thing, though ever So Secretly carried “ on. I confeSs I was to blame. I have I	“ not entirely performed what I had pro-

“ I was transported with the pashon with “ which the beauteous stave had inSpired “ me, and reaSonably judging she would “ not be unkind, could I gain admittance ‘ . “ alone.; I did not allow a ressedlion of a “ Serious nature to enter my breast.

“ and must confeSs I Succeeded to my ut-“ most wishes. But possession cloys: I “ can now resse<5t; and am Sorry for my “ folly. The easier we gain possession of “ what we desire, the Sooner we grow “ weary of it.
“ Is not reaSon strong enough to Sub-‘‘ due theSe turbulent palSions? You assure “ me it is. You have given me an in-“ stance of it in that wiSe heathen, Socra-“ tes. I think he was a siirprizing man.
“ I will endeavour to imitate him.” I - ' commended his reSolution, and urged him to leave Hicapoli. Fie conSented, and we Soon after Set out for Galaza. Our journey was pleaSant enough, as the greatest part of our tiine was Spent in conversing together on the late adventures at

Hicopoli; and proper refledions made thereon.
• We staid at Galaza Some time, when
one day Achmat the Turk, with whom

we then were) introduced an English gen-. tleman to me, who had just been ranSom-
ed from flavery. He w'as going over to ' . England, and offered me his Service, in ' ^	^
carrying over any letters I had to Send.
I accepted of his kindneSs, and w'^as just going to write, when a packet arrived from Sophia, direfted to OSman. He opened it, and within v/as one from En land for me.
This was very lucky; for had I Sent my letters away by the English gentle-m,an, before I had received thoSe from England; it would not only have given me greater uneaSmeSs, but would alSo have cauSed my friends in England far greater, at the thoughts of their packet being lost.
I eagerly broke open the Seal, and the first that presented itSelf to my view, was . from my brother and sister. Therein they gave me the account which I before ' Sent you, concernihg the distreSs of my fair Charlotte, and the many Severe trials she had undergone.
The reading of this epistle gave me many different emotionsof joy, grief, fur-prize &c. that alternately took place in my mind; but recovering mySelf I proceeded
Mr. Charles Guildford. 233
ceeded to the peruSal of my other letters, from my parents,' the other from my friend Mr. Brown, my old tutor.
My parents, my brother, and sifter and my friend Mr. Brown all offered to ranSom me. How great was my pleasure! I immediately anSwered thele letters; assured them I was already at liberty. and acquainted them with the reaSons of my stay in Turkey, and that I would Set Sail for England, as Soon as I cenild . poSsibly part with the worthy OSman.
The English gentleman by our requests Spent the remainder of the day with us. Our Host, to entertain us generoufly treSpaffed on one of Mahomet’s commands by procuring Some excellent wine; of which each drank pretty freely. In the evening the English gentleman, having taken my packet, and affured me he should Set Sail the next day, and that he would take the greatest care imaginable of what I entrusted to him, took his leave;
We continued a little longer at Galaza, and then Set out for Adrionople. When we arrived there, I was greatly Surprized at the appearance of the place, as I really
expedted

expedled it would ha\T m.ade a far better, appearance tlian I found i^ did.	,	• '
The old leraglio, and a few other places destined for the uSe of the Grand Seignior, and Some of his prime niinisters, still retain a look of prelieminence over the rest ; yet there was nothing extraordinary in them.
We sta^d a short time in this city, took a view of the principal parts, and then went down to Constantinople.
If I v/as Surprized at the appearance • which Adrionople makes, I was much more Surprized, and my disappointment was far greater, when I arrived at Constantinople, the metropolis of the Turkish	'
empire, where one of the grandest and most powerful Mon arch s in Europe resides ; where the Ottoman family keep their court, and hold their great Divan’s,
&c. ResteDions of this nature raiSed my expedations to a very great heighth, and that might, perhaps, make it appear more deSpicable to me : But I must confeSs, I only esteemed the whole of this large city.
Suburbs, &c. on each side of the river, as a confuSed heap of irregular buildings.
The Grand Seignior’s Seraglio is a very large extensive building, but I cannot Say
that
Mr. Charles Guildford. 235
tliat I much admire the beauty of that edifice, So far as I could See of it. I do '	not in the least doubt but the apartments
are richly furnished, according to the fassiion of the country, but thoie I could not See.
The gardens, looking into the i\rchi-i	pelago, must be extremely pleaSant, and
are generally reckoned to be very grand and noble ; but as to that I cannot affirm any thing farther concerning them, as I was never admitted into them. One thing I must confeSs, that when you are upon the water, at Some distance from the city, it appears extremely well, and it really affords a very beautiful proSpeD, as you fee the >tops of the moSques and leraglios, &c. which, by the resseDion of the Sun’s light, on the whole make a beautiful appearance. The irregularity of theSe structures, and their being diSperSed . . amongst the rest of the buildings, adds much to the beauty of the whole, and has then a very agreeable effeCt on the eye ; but a stranger who takes a proS-X	pect of the city (which I should before
have observed, lies upon a declivity towards the water, which renders the landscape still more agreeable) I Say, when

<	He told me his design in this was, to
turn all his treaSure into a portable Substance, and then he would accompany me X	to England, where he intended tp Spend
the residue of his life, in the profession of ■ that religion he had, through convidtion, embraced ; and where, he hoped,he should for the future, enjoy the pleaSures of my company, &c.
I was extremely glad of this ; and that I needed not now any longer dread So cruel a Separation, as I was Sensible ours must have been on each side.
When Haley arrived at Constantinople with his attendants, &c. thoSe staves that choSe to go over with us, into Europe, were freed, but continued in the Service of their generous master. The others OStnan alSo made free, and gave to each a handSome preSent ;safter which he left them at liberty to go wherever they pleaSed.

issand ot Sicily, intending, from thence, for the Satisfaction of my friend’s curiosity, to proceed to Venice ; after a Sliort stay, to go to-Rome ; and from thence proceed, through Italy, to Paris ; and then to England.
Now, when I was out at lea, it was that I was pleaSed with the proSpect of Constantinople, for really it was beautiful.
We vrere got out into the open Seas, and were proceeding for the issand to which we were bound, with a fair wind, gr*eatly diverted with the rolling of the waves, and the pleafantneSs of the Sea, when the Scene was, to our very great fur- - ^ prize, entirely changed.	^

But all at once ; at once the winds ariSe,
The thunders roll, theforky lightning sties.
In vain the master iSSues out commands ;
In vain the trembling Sailors, ply their hands;
The tempest, unforeSeen, prevents their care,
And, from the first, they labour in deSpair:
The giddy Snip, 'between the winds and tide:s
Forc’d back and forwards, in a circle rides; Stunn’d with the diffstent blows, then llioots amain,
’Till counter-buff’d, she stops, and steeps again.	^

The long expedled blow came at last ; the stiip Sprunk a prodigious leak ; we every moment expedted to sink. The boat v/as immediately ordered out, and every one crouded as fast as possible into her. OSman, and mySelf, had taken care

ing ship.
The ship drove on right before the wind	^
till she bulged on a rock, on which we were cast, by the violent motion of the	, ,
vessel, when she struck. We were very much hurt and bruiSed ; however, we with difficulty, got up towards the top,	|
where we might rest in'Safety *Srom the , - i waves. There v/e continued till day ap- ■ peared, vrhen we found ourSelves in a	I
country, which, to us,Seemed uninhabited.
Not the mark or footsteps, of any human	*
creature appeared to our view; the wreck i was fixed to the bottom of the rock, a monstrous depth below,and made us tremble at the sight. How had we, in that	!
dreadful time, through fear, gained	J
the heighth of Such an enormous rock ?	M
We each returned thanks to that Being, whoSe hand had So visibly Saved and protected us in this imminent time of danger.
^ We still put our trust and confidence in	[
Him,
I
Mr. Charles Guildford. 241
Him, who had hitherto been our only -guardian, though we were adtually desti-,	tute of the common necessaries of life, and
had Saved nothing out of our ship, but the cloaths we had on.
We could, from the rock, perceive that the country in which we were, was plea-Sant and agreeable. The day began to
►	clear up, and by the earth below, we perceived the Sun, when in the Meridian,
I	was excessive hot; but to remedy this,
the land was cooled vrith Several rivers,
I	-and adorned with many woods, &c. that
I	were diSperSed about the country.	•
|t•	After we had viev/ed.the country round
-us, we got down on the land side, and immediately made for the nearest, wood we .	Saw, which, when we entered, we found
;	it to be extremely pleaSant, and which was
?	rendered more So, by a winding river that
|i	ran through it. We found Several Sorts
I	of fruits, roots, &c. with which Oiman
was acquainted. We eat freely of them, drank at the river, and thereby very
►	much refreshed ourfeives. This done, we Sat down to reOect on the very great vicissitudes of human life. How mutablo " are all things here belovr! Good Sometimes arrives, when least expedted, and
VoL. I.	M	many

many evils come unforeseen ; but their vicilTitude is So great, and the change So often and So Sudden, that we ought not to put too much confidence in the one,
‘ or repine too much at the loSs of the other.
How numberlefs are the woes of human life ! Dangers at all times invade and Surround us. DiSeaSes and disappointments,	,
from adverle fortune, or our own follies, from private or public enemies; from ■ friends ; from our families, from our most intimate concerns ; and from ten thou-siind various cauSes.	j
Religion was now our comfort, and	|
our dependance on the Supreme Being, our only Support. How true are theSe words of the poet:

We had wandered through a great part oS the wood into which we had at first entered, and found it very large and exten-r live, and furnished with many uSeful palatable fruits, roots, &c.
We Saw Several horrid beasts, whole xlevouring jaws, we, with difficulty, avoided.

WHEN we had found the wreck, we consulted Some time what method we should make uSe of to get to her.
^ Trueman could Swim very well, I could Swim tolerably, but OSman could not.
We laid a plan in order to purSue, and then Trueman and I jumped in ; OSman stood on the shore, very much SurpriSed at the rapidity with which we cut the rising Surges. ShakeSpear gives a beautiful description in his Tempests of a per-Son Swimming in a storm, but I shall not trouble you with it, you are well acquainted with that author’s works.
We got to the ship in Safety, but it was with very great difficulty that we got into her; she was pretty much damaged, yet there was not any great quantity of water in her.
We found aboard Several planks, of which we made a stoat, and let it down into the water ; then fixing Several ropes, S . hanging down her side, to affist us in get- ’ 'ting up again ; we fixed a strong cable to the side of the ship, and throwing a Sufficient quantity over upon our stoat, with a
Small
Mr. Charles Guildford 255
Small stick of timber, and Several of the carpenters tools, &c. fit for our uSe, we got down upon the stoat, and with rowing and dragging, got it to the nearest part of the shore, fit for landing on.
OSman, with open arms, received us, extremely glad of our Safe return. I told him as he was not aboard, and as we had not then tried our stoat, we had not brought any thing but what was for present uSe. He wondered at our materials, and enquired the uSe, which we Soon shewed him.
We dug a deep hole, wherein we fixed our pole, which was large and strong. We then drew up the cable, the one end of which was fixed to the fide of the veS-fel, and drawing it as tight as v;e could with all our force, we fixed it firm to the post we had Set up, and made the whole Secure. This was for a guide for our stoat.
When every thing was ready, v:e ail of us got on board our stoat, went to the ship, got in, examined it, and found many things which were not hurt by the water.
The chest wherein all our treaSure lay, was Safe ; this was great joy to us, as we.
hoped
25si M E M O I R S of
hoped Soon to get out of that place. We Secured this chest, and Some other things, aboard our float, and Set Sail for land, where we Soon arrived in Safety by the help of our cable.
With our carpenter’s tools, we made a little four wheeled carriage, to draw our chest and other things up to the wood.
We got Sail cloth, furniture, and man)r other valuable effects out of the vessel; built a large commodious hut in the wood,' and strongly fortified it against any foreigrr invaders.
No relief, or proSpedt of any, appearing, we continued our daily labour, and with a cloSe application to our busineSs, we, at length, pretty well cleared our veS-’
1 - fel, and willing to make the most of her, we broke up her quarter deck. &c, and by de^^rees got a pretty large quantity of boards', ana other timber from her ; when-one night a storm arofe, which continued all that night, and great part of the next day. So that it did not entirely clear up till the day after. We then went to vifit the remains of our, wreck, but found it gone, therefore we had no more to expeSt from that quarter.

Here the captain’s instruments, books, pens, ink, and paper, &c. which I found in his cabin, were of infinite Service to us.
The mathematical books were either in Latin, Italian, French, or English, either of which I understood tolerably well.

We kept a constant look out towards the Sea,^hoping relief from that part; but to no purpoSe. Uncertainty we then thought worfe than death, and at length relblved, one and all, to Secure our treasure and venture up into the inland parts after we had taken a large compaSs by the Sea coast.
'	Preparations were made for our depar-

pleaSant, after having taken a farewel look, (as we intended it.) We were returning from the Sea shore, when we were agreeably Surprized with the appearance of a ship, that drove, before the wind, which blew full for land, tho* not very strong.
She dropped her anchor as near the fiiore as she possibly could, and Soon after Sent her boat to land. We joyfully welcomed the men on shore, I found they were bound for the issand of Cyprus, and after that were to proceed to Venice. They had been out Some time, tossed about with contrary winds, and wanted water which was the reaSon of their making to land. We very readily gave them what assistance we could, and when they were Supplyed, made our preSent situation, So far as related to our being cast away, and unprovided of any means to get off that dil’agreeable shore, known to them.
They in anSwer to this told us, they would make their captain, who was a good natured man, acquainted v/ith our ■ cafe, and they did not doubt but he would immediately give orders for the boat to return and fetch us on board if

we were diSpoSed to take the voyage with them and land us at Venice, if we approved it.
We in anfwer to this informed them that we should think ourSelves greatly obliged to the captain, and them for Such a very great kindneSs, and at the Same time informed them that when wt came to Venice we could pay for our passage, and would likewiSe reward them for their trouble. For as to paying immediately for our passage, we thought it was not proper to give them the least hint that it was then in our power to do it, as we did not know what Sort of a perSon the captain was, or what the principles of his men were, and as we judged it might be of dangerous conSequence to let any one, especially in that part of the world, know the riches we were possessed of, riches being often too great a temptation for many to resist.
The Sailors on this put off for the ship, and we with eager eyes stood on the shore, watching the motion of the boat, and waiting her return with the greatest anxiety.
We Soon after faw the boat gain the ship, and in a very short time, to our

great joy law her returning to land. As Soon as the boat came to the fitore, a genteel man, with great adlivityjimiped on land, whom we took, for a Superior officer and Soon found we were not mistaken for' it was the captain himSelf.
The moment he approached us, I knevv him, and he as Soon recognized me. He embraced me with great demonstrations of joy, and in the French language, which he Spoke fluently affured me, that the relation he had received from his men, had given him great pleaSure as it enabled him to relieve three of his fellow'-creatures out of the greatest distreSs, but that this pleaSure vras greatly heightened by discovering that one of them was a per-fon he had a great regard for.
. OSman, the captain, and mySelf then walked up the country a little way, and when we were out of sight of the Sailors, and in no fear of being overheard I freely difclofed to the captain, the real situation of our affairs, and the treaSure wo ‘	were poffeffed of.
‘	The captain was a Venetian, man a
of very great honour and humanity, and the confidence I placed in him, was N 2	the
268 M E M O I R S of
the least return I could make him for his friendly behaviour.
He in the most genteel and generous manner offered us a paffage for ourSelves and Trueman to Venice, and alSo to carry our riches, and whatever we had Saved out of the wreck, freight-free. As to the latter wt strongly oppoSed it, and he at length with much reludlance agreed with us for our paffage and alSo for the freight of our goods, '&c. Our things were Soon fetched down to the Sea side, put into the boat, and Soon on board.
We then waited a short time for the wind when that proving favourable. So as to permit us to leave that place, we weighed our anchor and Set Sail.
Not to enter into any other particulars, stis Sufficient to inform you that we arrived in Safety at Cyprus, a fine issand, one hundred and fifty miles long, and Seventy broad: Subjedt to the Turks.
We stayed at Cyprus Some time, but for OSman’s fake we did not think proper to go on fiiore, but continued on board the ships.
I am unwilling to quit this issand without Saying Something'of it. But tore-turn to our own affairs. 'Ishe Captain

having finished his bnsineSs at Cyprus we Set Sail. But misfortunes Seemed to at> tend us, with an obstinate perSeverance.
We had not been many days out at Sea, before a strong gale of wind Sprung up, in a contrray part of the heavens, to that from whence it had lately blown, and notwithstanding the utmost endeavours of the master and Sailors drove us, much against our wills, on the coast of Egypt.
We were obliged to comply with what was too powerful for us to resist, and therefore fubmitted, only taking care the ship should not be drove on the land.---Luckily just as we approached the shore,	S
a flat calm Succeeded to this violent gust,	!
and the captain ordered the anchor to be	|
dropped.	.	;
The Captain on my enquiring in what	;
part of the world we were, informed me,	I
we were not far, he was certain from one of the mouths of the famous Egyptian river viz. the Nile.
This railed in me a strong desire of fecr ing a part of that river So famous in hif-tory. I told the captain of this, and ashed him, if it would be any inconvenience to Send his boat with me and OSman, who - .	N 3	was

He anSwered no, provided we did not stay long, for that he must embrace the first fair wind which offered for Sailing, otherwise, if lie should negledl it. and any accident should happen to the ship, before he finished his voyage, though ever So remote, he should be liable to make good to his owners all damages, w^as it even the total loSs of the ship and cargo.
When I understood this, a cireumStance I had not before thought of, I told him I would readily lay aside the thought of going, but as I had expressed a deSire of Seeing this river, he insisted on it, that I should not be disappointed, only begged I would excuSe his going with us, as the late accident had created Some busi-neSs for his men to regulate Some things’on board and to prepare for Sailing, and that his duty as Captain obliged him to continue on board to Super-intend his men, and give necessary direDions, &c.

I, (the boat being ready) got in, leaving Trueman on board, who at that time was ill and could not attend us.
We

We coasted along the shore for Some time, then landed and having received proper diredtions from one of the Sailors as far as he could give us; Ofman and I went on leaving the Sailors with the boat.
We viewed the country as we walked, and employed our eyes to the best advantage, and for once feasted them with a sight of every thing that could come within their ken.
We had entered into an engaging con-verfation on all the works of nature that appeared before us, and had by that means wandered a confiderable way up the country without immediately going along the coast, but yet could not difcoverany thing of the river. After we had wandered about a considerable time, without observing how the time passed night approached before we once thought of returning.
This Surprized us, and on looking at my watch I found we had been abSent from the boat above four hours, and how the time had passed we could not conceive or otherwife account for it, than from the attention of both of us being deeply engaged in a very interesting converfation that we had had on a variety of curious and entertaining fubjedts.
We

We recolledled that we had walked fast, notwithstandingourconverSation, and jLidged we could not be much IcSs than 15 or .16 miles at least from the boat Supposing v/e had walked in a right line : of this however we were not certain. We had been too regardleSs of the way we came, to .know show to return whilst it was light, much leSs could we exped to find our way back in the dark. I then began to be uneaSy for my friend, who through me was induced to take this ramble. He discovered my uneaSineSs and desired I would not give mySelf any pain on his account; for he did not fear but that, v/e should ieturn in Safety in the morning, if we could not get back that night, and that it was only taking our lodo-ing for one night in the first convenient tree vve could meet with. “ But,” Says he “perhaps the Moon will ‘‘rife Soon and assist us ; how old is the “ Moon?” On this I began to consider and having luckily the preceding night observed the time of the Moon’s riS-ing, found she would riSe in about two hours. Ihis gave us fresh Spirits, and we had nov/ nothing to do but to Secure curSelves for tliofe two hours, which we

Soon did by climbing up into a tree which luckily grew on an elevated place, from which we judged vre should have an extensive proSpedt when the Moon roSe. All we bad now to wish for, was a fine night.
When we were Secure, that the time might not paSs heavily we renewed our former conversation and our two hours w'ere Scon elapSed, when to our very great joy the Moon roSe, and in a ssiort time shone extremely bright, and v/e had a very extensive proSpedt of a country as agreeable as most I have Seeen.
Notwithstanding the extensiveneSs of our proSpedb we could not however See either the Sea or the river we had been in Search of. However to our left, at a prodigious distance from us, and about the part where I Suppofed our ship lay, I thought I could diScern Something like the top-Sails of our ship, which after ' considering for fome time we both concluded must be the ship at anchor.
I	On this we got down, and determined
'	to go right on in that diredtion, and never
j	loSe sight of the destined place.

We piirfucd our little journey v/ith Spirit tor a considerable time but to no pur-poSe, We could not di'ccver either our ■ship Or the Sea. We nevertheless continued in the Same direftion till the Sun roie, and preScnted us the finest pioSpedl; of the heavens, and the moSt beautiful morning I had ever Seen. GSman was greatly charmed with it, for he had never feen Such a glorious fight before.
But our joy vtas Soon turned into Sorrow. We had not long continued on our journey, after Sun-riSing when ^we WTre Surrounded by a dozen indigent istfolent Turks, who we had reafon to believe were a gang of thieves. We V7ere immediately Seized. Refistance was in vain, they stripped and bound us. Then Searched our cloaths, divided the booty amongst them, when two who appeared Superior to the rest undressing equipped themSelves in our cloaths, which they appeared to do out of a frolic and gave us their’s which after they had unbound us they obliged us to put on. Then fastening us together drove us off in very great haste in the midst of them.

I by my conversation with OSman, and the stay I had made in Turkey could Speak their language indifferently, and therefore by OSman’s desire, applied to thefe wretches to condudl; us to our ship and promised them we would pay them any I	reasonable Sum for our ranforn. But to •
this they only anfwered we were too far from the fea for them to return: that ]	they had busineSs of more conScquencc,
that if they had not, they would not trust a couple of Christian dogs, that we were at preSent their staves, without hope of re-]	demption ; that they could not lofe time in

LETTER I.
Y last gave you an account of ^ M ^ heitig made captives by a Set of raScally Turks, and ve-Js j.y villainous fellows we found them.—They uSed us extremely ill, and the only name they gave us was Christian dogs. They obliged us to run on foot as fast as they rode, and if we at any time halted, they forced us on with blows. One thing was favourable for VoL. II.	B	us
t

us, ^ cife we should have been absolutely killed with fatigue. The circumstance was this, Some of their horSes were old, lean, half starved beasts, that they uSed almost as bad as they did us, and with Such beasts they could not travel very fast. I assure you this was of infinite Service to us, we often wished every beast they had was lame. But however we were very thankful their condition was no better.	I
We had travelled in this manner a con-	I .
siderable time, when we learnt they in-	!
tended to Sell us at Cairo Notwithstand-	!
ing we were to be Sold as staves, yet I must acknowledge it gave us great pleaSure that it was at Cairo we were to be Sold,
^ becauSe I hoped there to meet with Some of the European conSuls or fadstors or Some one who would engage for our ranSom, or that at the worst we should easily find means to Send to Venice or to England.
We were communicating our Sentiments to each other on this Subjedt, and by that means endeavouring to* relieve ourSelves a little, under the preSent load of miSery, at a place where our wretches stopped to bait, v/hen a villainous 7’urk,
who
Mr. Char-LeS Guildford. 3
who we fuppoSest was appointed for that purpoSe, listened with great attention to our diScourSe, and though we Spoke in French, he understood a part of what we Said, our Speaking of conSuls and fadtors,
&c, made theSe fellows SuppoSe we had interest at Cairo, and that we could get money there, but we found by their diScourSe, that they judged we could by our interest at Cairo get them Seized for their unwarrantable proceedings with us, and were therefore determined to prevent us, which they thus cffedled.
As Soon as we arrived at Cairo, they locked us up in a private houSe and there kept us two or three days, but they Supplied us with provisions enough, which we SuppoSe was for their own advantage.	?
At the end of this time, a Surly, ill-look-	I
ing fellow was introduced to US; who after	i
examining us in many particulars, tending	i
to discover who and v/hat we were, and to whoSe interrogatories we gave in general equivocal fanSwers, purchaSed us of our thieves and immediately took us to shis own houSe, where to our very great mortification, we found he was an Armenian, that he designed to carry us up the country for fear of the conSequences B 2	should
f
1
4 M E M' O I R S of
should any of the European ConSuls inter-poSe, and in the night we were hurried off with Several others, as wretched as our-Selves.
I will affure you our preSent Situation was So terrible, that had not our hands been confined, we fiiould have attempted	'
every thing in our power, to regain our liberty, even at the hazard of our lives: for defpair had made us deSperate, but the artful Armenian had before met with deSperate Europeans who would not patiently Submit to their fate, and had therefore taken So much care, that we had not even the least hope left.
Notwithstanding we were in Such a si-tuation, yet we met with Something to alleviate our distreSs. This was the company and conversation of a young gentleman, who was a fellow Slave: his name was Omar. He came from ISpahan the capital of Persia, and had been taken travelling, nearly in the fame unfair manner as we were. He was a youth who had received a liberal education, and had travelled much. He appeared to be a ge-	j
nius of the first rank, and this added to a lively wit, rendered him one of the
most
I
—------------^________________________________
Mr. Charles Guildford. §
most agreeable companions I had ever met with.
OSman was as much pleaSed with him as I was: we Soon contrasted a friendship tor each other, and had it not been for our miserable situation, we should have formed a very happy triumvirate.
In a few days we stopped at Some place on the Red Sea, but what the place was I really do not know. I Saw nothing of it, therefore shall not pretend to fay anything concerning it.
Though we could not improve by observations, we gained by our friend O-mar’s communicative temper. He had travelled over part of Egypt, particularly on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. We were inquiring about Cairo from whence we came. He informed us that Cairo was Subject: to the Turks, and governed by a Beglerbeg, who had a revenue of fix hundred thouSand Scheriff’s or Zechins a year. TheSc coins are called alSo xeriffs and che-queens, and are worth about nine shillings; and four pence, five pence or fix pence sterling. This Salary is paid out of the grand Seignior’s treafury, and yet the So-^ vereign does not loSe any thing by it, for
B 3	he
6 M E M O I R S of
he has as much paid him from the country, and there is another Sum of six hundred thouSand zechins, or chequeens applied yearly to pay the Turks who are ftT tioned there. Tliii Beglerbeg commands sixteen Sangiacks or provinces. A pretty extensive dominion for one Beglerbeg, of which there are in different parts of the Turks dominions near thirty, though every Beglerbeg hath not the command of quite fo many provinces.
Grand Cairo is one of the princpal ci« ties In Egypt, and may be looked upon as the Metropolis: for there the Begler-' beg resided, when we had the misfortune to be trapanned into ssavery. Gianber built it, and about the year of the Hegira 362 he made it the royal Seat.
Cairo is called Great or Grand Carlo, in reSpect of the advantages, which it has above all the cities of Africa. It is situated about 2 or 3 leagues lower and on the opposite side to that place where the antient Memphis stood. ITere is a castle * which is built on a rising ground commands a very fine proSpect, and enjoys I an excellent air. Ishis castle has been very large, magnificent, and Strong, but is
now
Mr. Charles Guildford. ’7
now greatly decayed and altered for the worSe. It is however beautified with Several pieces of MoSaic work, which is really curious. The water of the Nile is conveyed thither by an aquediict of one hundred and fifty arches. The inhabitants of Cairo a=:e very numerous, an instance or two to prove this is recorded in history. In the year 1618 there died . above six hundred thouSand people of the pestilence, and yet there was Scarce any of the inhabitants in appearance missing. In a plague that happened about the year 1672, there were six hundred eighty thouSand of the poor people died, and only about four hundred of the richer Sort.
It has been computed that this city contains two hundred thouSand houSes, near eighteen thouiand considerable streets, and that it is between tv/enty and thirty f'	leagues in circumference. But in this
computation are included Old and New Cairo, Festat, Babylon, Charaffat and the Boulac, that may be Said to join all together ; for New Cairo alone is not So large as Paris, which is much lels than London.

■’Tis at Cairo that thofe fine carpets are-made that we call Turkey carpets. It was about five miles South-East of the py-ramids, and two from the Nile West that the regal city of Memphis formerly stood, which was once the strength and glory of Old Egypt, in which city was the temple of Apis, and the Sumptuous temple of Vulcan. Here alSo stood the face of Venus, and that of Serapis. A city once adorned with many antiquities, but now even the ruins are almost gone.

LETTER II.
IN my last you had Some account of Cairo, which I gave you for your entertainment, and wish it may afford you as much pleaSure in the reading as it did us when we heard it.
I shall in this give you a short account of Aleppo, as I think it will afford you a more agreeable amuSement than a dull and disagreeable relation of the miSeries we Suffered in our ssavery, and the anxieties we ffelt under Such mortifying circumstances.
Aleppo is the principal, as well as the-largest city of Syria, one of the m.ost famous of the east, and the third in the Ottoman empire, if we consider it as the rendezvous, of the Caravans, and of the Turkish armies; as the magazine of jewels, Spices, silks, and other valuable commodities, which are brought thither by Sea or land, and from thence Sent into other parts of the world, by the port of Alexandretta or Scanderoon.
This city is situated about one hundred miles from. Akxandretta or Scanderoon,
whiclt
\
^
10 M E M O I R S of
which is the Sea port and road for all ships to lade and unlade their goods, which are transported by camels to and from Aleppo. Their commodities are chiefly silks, camlets, gallnuts, valaneed, a fort of acornshell uSed by curriers to dreSs their leather, cotton, yarn mohairs, Soap, drugs of all forts, galls, &c.
I'hey alSo deal in gold, Silver and precious stones &c. that are Sold by the Mit-tagal, which is one dram and a half. As for Alexandretta or Scanderoon, the Sea port of Aleppo, it only consists of a Sew despicablehouSes inhabited by the Greeks, who keep public drinking houSes for the Sailors, and the meaner Sort of the people, where many Turks often make free to break their prophets command, that they should not drink wine, and that together with the stridl injundtion he laid on them to keep themSelves clean were two of the most political and best institutions any law giver ever made ; for the Turks in general, are a very filthy people, and madmen when they get drunk; therefore this Sufficiently evinces the necessity of the above positive laws.
The dwellings appointed for the vice-confuls are convenient, and are the only
build-
Mr. Charl Es Guildford. ii
buildings of any Signification, in this Seaport. The air here is very bad, especially in Summer. It kills many, and is produdlive of very dangerous distempers.
As we are, at prefent in Egypt, I think to add to your entertainment, I will from Varenius give you a very curious account of the river Nile, or rather two accounts, the one antient, the other modern. You may not have Varenius by you, or if you have. Some of your friends who think theSe letters worth their peruSal, may not, this is therefore my reaSon for the quotation I am going to make.
Varenius obServes that Some rivers at a Set time of the year, riSe beyond their banks and overstow the adjacent countnes. The first and most celebrated among theSe is the Nile, which Swells to Such a degree that it covers all the land of Egypt except the Hills. The deluge begshs about the Seventeenth ot June, and increaSes forty days, and decreaSes as many. So that at this time, all the cities wshich are most of them built upon hills, appear like So many islands. Antiquity hath given a large account of this inundation; becauSe in j	that part of the earth which vras then
B 6	known
12 M E M O I R S gI
known (before the eastern and western’ parts were discovered) sto river was found to be the Same, except the Niger, which therefore was fuppoSed to communicate with the Nile under ground. Seneca,, (Says Varenius) has deScribed the inundation of the Nile, the best of all the anti-ents, and therefore I cannot but give it in his words.
“ The Nile (Says he) is increaSedin the-middle of Summer; from before the riS-ing of the little Dog star, to beyond the autumnal equinox. Nature hath placed ' this most noble river in the sight of all mankind, and ordered it So, that it should overflow Egypt at a time when the earth,, being driest with the Summer heat, might fuck in more of its witer, and Sufficiently quench its annual thirst. For in that part of Egypt which lies towards Ethiopia, there are few or no showers; and thoSe that fall do not refresh the earth, which is unaccustomed to rain-water. Egypt builds her whole hope upon this, and is fertile or barren, according as the river affords it more or leSs water. The hushand-man never minds the heavens, and the poet Ovid does not jest when he Says,
«Th*
Mr. Charles Guildford
“ The herbs beSeech not Jove to pour “ HimSelf upon them in a shower.
If we knew where it begins to increaSe we might perhaps find out the cauSe of its increaSe, But after it hath wandered over vaSc deSerts, and made its way thro* fens and marshes, and unknown countries, it colledls its disorderly waters about Phi-las The island of Fhilas being on every side rocks and rugged, is washed by two^ rivers which there come together and Surround the whole iOand. TheSe having their former names mix together and are called the Nile, which being increaSed in breadth, glides gently from thence thro* Ethiopia, and the Sandy deSarts that afford a passage to the commerce of the Indian Sea. The cataracts atterwards receive it, which sill the eye with Something great and amazing ; there the Nile rushes against the broken mountains in its way, and is forced into the narrow passages and hollows that are made in the hard rocks, dashing against the stones that obstrudl its current, and overflowing Sometimes all the obstacles that interrupt it. Here its courSe is obstruded, which,
makes
}
14- M E M O I R S of
which makes it rife in waves and Surges: and there it is confined between two rocks and frets and foams to be enlarged; So that its waters which before glided gently along, being put into violent agitation, rush from one rock to another, and make it appear more like a torrent than a river. Now it looks thick, muddy and troubled and half covered with froth, which is not its natural colour, but owing to the injury of the places it stowed through. At length having freed itSelf from all obsta-^ cles, it falls on a Sudden from a prodigious heighth and with a noiSe dreadful to the country thereabouts; which the colony that , were placed there, by the PerSians, could not endure; their ears being stunned with the continual noiSe, that they were forced to transport themSelves to more quiet habitations. The incredible boldneSs of the inhabitants is reported among the miracles of this river. They get into their boats by pairs, the one guides it, and the other throws out the water, and after thay have tumbljed Sometime among the raging waves' of the Nile, they get into the narrowest channels, and avoid as much as poSSible the dangerous creeks in the rocks; then guiding the boat with
their

their hands, they are carried headlong down the middle of the current, by the force of the whole river, and when the Spedlators are in great fear and begin to lament, believing they are oveiSet and tirowned by the great weight of the water, yet they are in an instant Seen Sailing a great way from the place where they fell down, being carried as Swift as a stone out of an engine. Nor does the boat in its fall overSet, but is carried Safe into the Smooth water. Tile first rising of the Nile, is perceived about the aforementioned ifie of Philas, a little way from whence it is divided by a rock, called by the Greeks, Abaton, ‘ which none ever aScend but their rulers: there the rising of the river is observed and marked upon the sides of the rock. A great way below this there are two eminent rocks called, by the inhabitants, the Veins of the Nile, from which a great force of water fiowetii; yet not So much as to do any harm to Egypt. The priests throw offerings in at their mouths and the governors gifts of gold, while the holy rites are performing. From this place the Nile Seems as if it had got new strength, and rolls along a narrow
and
i6 M E M O I R S of
and deep channel, being hemmed in by the mountains on each side, and hindred from enlarging its breadth. When it comes to Memphis, it is again at liberty,	■’
and wanders over the countrv, dividinp’ itSelf into rivulets, and ciistuSmg its streams over all Egypt, through innumerable canals made by art, as commodious as poffible. At first it is divided,, but the waters being continued, it stagnates and appears like a large troubled Sea. The breadth of the country rhro’ which it is extended, breaks the violence of its current, being no leSs than the whole land of Egypt. As much as the	i
Nile increases So much do their hopes for that year, and the hushandman is not de-ceived who computes his proclud by the meaSure pf the river. It brings troubled water and mud upon the land and dry Soil, and leaves its dregs and filth upon the ground that is most chapped with draught, and v/hatever clammy fatneSs-it brings along with it, is Sprinkled upon; the driest places; So that it manures the ground two ways, by watering it, and covering it with mud; but the places it doth not reach are bare and unfruitful.,
If it increaSe above Such a height it does

not So well. The nature of this river is alSo wonderful; for when other Smtll rivers waste, and wash out the fatneSs of the earth, the Nile, by how much it excels , others in greatneSs, is So far from wasting and eating out any thing, that it rather adds new vigour to the pining ground, at least puts it into a better temper, by Saturating the Sandy places with fiime and mud; So that Egypt does not only owe the fertility of its Soil to the Nile, but even the Soil itfelf. When It overflows the fields it makes a pleaSant appearance, for the plains and vallies 110 hid under the water, and the towns, appearing like iflands are only to be Seen ; and they have no commerce one with anot her in the inland places but by boats; the leSs alSo the people See of their lands the more they rejoice. When the Nile is confined within its banks, it is poured into the lea by Seven mouths and every one of them hath the appearance of a Sea, besides Several other Irnall branches, and canals that are cut from one shore to another. Moroever it breeds living creatures equal in bulk and noxiouSnefs to my at Sea, from whence one may judge

of its greatneSs, by its aff. rding room to play in, and Sustenance Sufficient for Such vak animals. Eabillus the best	'
of men, and shilled in all kinds of learn-	'■
ing, relates, that when he went gover-	:
nor into Egypt, he Saw at the Hera-	;
cleotic mouth of the Nile (which is the greatest) a company of Dolphins coming from the Sea, that were met by a troop of	;
Crocodiles from the river, as it were to give one another battle. The Dolphins though they are harmleSs animals and do not bite, yet they were too powerful for	i
the Crocodiles, whofe backs are hard and	'
impenetrable even to the teeth of larger	;
' animals than themSelves, but their bellies and lower parts are Soft and tender, into theSe the Dolphins, Swimming under water, thrust their long Spikes or prickly fins which they carry upon their backs, and wounded them So that^theylet out their bowels by which Several of them being killed the rest turned their tails and fled. They are creatures that ssy from the bold, and purSue the timorous; nor do the inhabitants of Tentyra overcome them So much by their natural or Superior valour as by their rashneSs and contempt of them; for they follow them of their own accord, and
drive
Mr. Charles Guildford. ip
drive them into the Snares of nets that are laid for them; tho a great many of them that have not courage enough to piirSue like the rest, are destroyed. TheophraS-tus relates, that the Nile once brought down Sea water; and it is certain that when Cleopatra reigned it did not rife for ■ two years, viz, in the eleventh and twelfth years of her reign, which they Say portended bad fortune to two great persons, viz, to Anthony and Cleopatra,
I	who Soon after lost their empires. Calli-
machus relates, that the Nile, in former ages, did not overflow for nine years.
Now I come to enquire Into the cauSe of the Nile’s overflowing in Summer, and I flaall first begin with the opinions of the antients. Anaxagoras was of opinion, that the melted Snov/s poured down from the mountains of Ethiopia into the Nile, makes it overflow; and all the antients believed this to be the caufe; ES-chylus, Sopocles, and Euripides, have taught the Same. But this is evidently falSe for Several reaSons., First, Ethiopia, is the hottest country upon earth, as appears from the tawny or fun-burnt colour of the inhabitants, and the Troglo-dites who build their houSes under ground:
the
1
JO MEMOIRS of
the rocks alSo are as hot as fire, not only at noon but even at the cloSe of the clay; the dust under foot is So hot that men cannot walk upon it; silver is unSoldered, the joints of images are disjoined, and whatever is laid on them for ornament dissolves or is peeled off. The South wind, which blows from theSe places, is immoderately hot, and thoSe creatures as Serpents, &c. that elSe where uSed to hide themSelves in the winter, never withdraw there, but are found in the open field's all	‘
the year. There is no Snow nor heavy rain falls at Alexandria, which is a great	;
way removed from theSe immoderate	*
heats. How therefore should a country Subjedl to So much heat, be covered with Snow all the winter! Some mountains indeed may have Snovr on them there, but , not more than the ridges of Thracia or CaucaSus; and the rivers that stow from ^ theSe last. Swell in the Spring, and the beginning of Summer, and are leSs again in winter; becauSe that in the Spring the Snow is washed down by the rain, and if any is left it is melted by the first heat of the Sun. Neither the Rhine, Rhone, IS-ter, nor Cayster, are Subjedl to this; they	1
only are out a little in Summer, though	'
the.
Mr. Charles Guildford. it
the Snows are very deep on the northern mountains. The Phasis, and the Boryst-thenes would alSo riSe at that time, if the Snow could produce great rivers against Summer. Moroever, if this were the cauSe of the increafr of the Nile, it would stow most at the beginning of the Summer, for then the Snow, being large and entire, is melted in greater cjuantities. But the Nile is in its grandeur four months, and is then alv/ays the Same. If we may believe Thales, the anniverSary north winds resist the deScent of the Nile, and hinder its courSe by driving the Sea in at the mouths of its channels,. So that being repulSed it runs back upon itSelf; and is not increased, but becauSe it cannot find a passage, it overflows and breaks out in every place where it can make its way. Euthemenes of MarSeilles, agrees with him, and gives this testimony. I have Sailed, Says he, in the Atlantic Sea whence the Nile flows larger as long as the anni-’ verSary north winds blow, becauSe that then the Sea being urged by the winds, replenishes its stream; but when they ceaSe, the Sea grows calm, and the Nile returns with leSs force. Besides, the Sea water is alfo Sweet, and dhe monsters in it re-

Semble thoSe of the Nile. But wherefore then, (Say I,) if theSe winds make the Nile Swell, doth it riSe before they begin	j
to blow, and continue after they are over> AlSo why doth it not grow greater when they blow stronger ; for it is not increased or lessened, when they blow more or leSs, which it should be if it depended on their force. Moroever, theSe winds	‘
blow against the shores of Egypt, and the Nile deScends the contrary way against them, but why should it not ssov/ from whence they bjow; if it hath its origin from them.f’ Besides, it would ss w from the Sea pure and green, not troubled and	|
muddy as it doth now. Add to this that innumerable witnesses contradidl this testimony, and though men might lie Safely and put any fables upon us, as long as the coasts were unknown; but nov/ the foreign coasts are frequented by merchant ships, yet none of them mention the the green colour of the Nile, or that the	i
lea hath any other taste than ufual; which is alSo disagreeable to nature for the Inn evaporates the lightest and freshest particles. Besides, why doth it not increaSe in winter, when the Sea is Sometimes raiSed with greater winds, than theSe annual
Mr. Charles Guildford. 23
nual ones which are commonly moderate, and further if it proceeded from the Atlantic Sea it would cover Egypt at once, and not by degrees as it does. Oenopi-des of Chios fays, that in winter the heat is kept under ground, and therefore dens and caverns are then hot, and mountain-water is warm alSo, that the veins of the earth are dried up by internal heat, but in other countries the rivers are replenished with rain: only the Nile which is not Supplied in winter, and increaSes in Summer, V'ihen the interior parts of the earth are cold, and the fountains are fresh and cool. But if this were true, all the foun-^ tains would increafe, and run over in Summer. Besides the Subterraneous heat is not greater in winter, though water, caves and wells, are then warm becauSe they do not admit the external cold air^ So that they are not absolutely hot, but only exclude the cold: for this reaSon they are cold in, Summer, becauSe the hot air is kept from them.
Diogenes Apolloniates Says, that as the Sun draws moisture to it. So the dry and j	parched earth draws it from the Sea, and
I	other waters, for it is impossible that one
part
i	I
I
j
24 M E M O I R S of
part of the earth should be dry whfen the other is moist, becauSe it is all over perforated and full of intercourses, through which the dry places draw moisture from the wet, otherwise they wmuld long since have been burnt up. For this reaSon, the fun draws the waters to it, and the meridian places that have most need of it; alfo where the earth is most dried it draws most msoisture to it. As in lamps the oil runs towards the place where it is conSumed, So the water runs towards that place where the earth is parched up with heat
From whence therefore should it come but from the cold northern parts ? Does not the Propontis for this reaSon constantly flow into lower Seas, not as others do by a flux and reflux, but by a constant and rapid courSe towards the Same point ? And unleSs by theSe intercourses, places that vranted vrere replenished by thoSe that abounded, the earth would be Soon dried to dust, or laid under v/ater.
I would willingly afk Diogenes, why, since the Sea and all rivers meet together they are not larger in all countries in the Summer? The Sun Scorches Egypt more
. than
I
'
Mr. Charles Guildford. 25
than other countries and therefore the Nile increases more; and in other parts of the earth there is alfo Some increaSe of the rivers. But I aSk him, why then is there any part of the earth without moisture ; since the hotter it is in any place, the more moisture it draws from other countries.? And, lastly, why is the Nile So Sweet, if it draws its water from the Sea ? For no water is So Sweet as the water of the Nile. So far Says Seneca.
And as Varenius obServes, from this
I	passage of Seneca, we gather the opinions
of the antients (eSpecially of the Greek philosophers) about the cauSe of the inundation of the Nile. But, as he further observes, none of them are true, becauSe in thole times nobody had travelled out of Europe, So far as the Springs of the Nile, or had visited the nations that border on them, which are very remote from Egypt. But the true cauSe is since discovered by the English, Dutch, and Portuguese, who trade with the nations that border upon theie Springs, in the king-

I must make my own observation here, that I think Verenius’s observation right, and by this we See what the learning of the antients in natural history and philosophy was, and this alSo shews us how much we are obliged to the moderns, particularly Lord Bacon, who laid the foundation for the glorious improvements since made.

The river Nile, or Abanes, which, in the Abyssine language, signifies the father of rivers, hath its fources, as is generally held, in 11 or 12 degrees of northern latitude, in the empire of Abyffmia, but whe-. ther the Portugueze jefuits, as is pretended, or any other perfons, have discovered the very fountains it iSfues from, is very much questioned. I perceive, the country where it rifes, as Some of the natives relate, is covered with vast impenetrable C 2	woods.

woods. This river runs a courSe of about fifteen hundred miles, from Ibuth to north, for the most part, and a little below Cairo, dividing itSelf into two branches, one inclining to the east, and the other to the west, falls into the Mediterranean; the two mouths being about 100 miles aSun-der. As for any other branches of this river, our modern travellers take no notice of them, and probably, thofe that have been mentioned by antient writers, were only canals, cut from thefe, particularly the canal which was made to convey water from the river to Alexandria, feems, in our maps, to be laid out for one. Elowever, certain it is, that there are no other branches navigable at this day, than thoSe of Damietta and RoS-fetto. While the river is contained within the bounds of the ordinary channel, I do not find it is broader at Old Cairo, than the Thames at London ; and, in the dry-est SeaSon of the year, is fordable in many places. In the upper parts of the stream tnere are feven cataraDs, v/here the water falls in sheets from, a very great height, causing a prodigious noiie •, but through Lower Egypt it Slides along with a very gentle stream, and passengers are

Seldom Surprized by tempests on it. It is observed, the water is very thick and muddy, eSpecially when it is Swelled by thoSe heavy rains which constantly fall within the Tropics in the beginning of the Summer, and theSe are the occasion of its'Overflowing the low lands of Egypt annually.
The Niger alSo, a river in Africa, of no leSs courSe than the Nile, though not So famous, overflows the adjacent countries at the Same time as the Nile does. When it is at the highest, people may Sail, in • boats, all over Negroland, though not without great danger.
So the Zaire, in Congo, overflows. The fame does the river Rio de la Plata, in Brasil. The Ganges alSo, and the Indus; theSe two last pour out their waters upon the earth in the rainy SeaSpn, viz. in June, July, and August, when the inhabitants gather the water into ponds, and preServe it, that they may be Supplied at other times of the year, when there is Scarce any rain. This inundation makes the land very fruitful.
The river which waters the royal city of Siam, called Menam, overflows in September, Odtober, and November, at which Q 3	time
30 M E M O I R S of
time the fields, and alSo the streets in the city, are wholly covered with water. So that the people are forced to make uSe of boats to Sail from one houSe to another. This caufes very great fertility.
The Euphrates alSo overflows Mesopotamia on Some particular days of the year ; there are others of kffer note that over-fiovr the countries through which they run, /or an account of which I refer you, to Varenius.
But Oh ! my friend! permit me, before I quit Egypt, here to make a reflection on the fate of empires, What a '	glorious state was Ifgypt once ? This was
a lourishing state when it took the name of Egypt, which was about 877 years after the flood, and doubtlcSs it had been :	a great kingdom many years before that
change was made.
It is now fuppofed to be the best peopled state in the world, but I cannot readily agree to that, b;caufe, I think, China ;	more populous by far. But it must be
ackno-wledged, if any dependance is to. be placed on history, that Egypt was for-;	nterly very well peopled ; an instance of

the feign of AmaSis, it contained above 20,000 cities.
It Jias, likewise, for many ages, produced very large quantities of corn, which was the reafon that the Romans called it the publick granary of the v/orld. And, in ■ fad't, it is observed, that the plenty, or Scarcity, of all the Roman empire depended on the harvest of Egypt. They owe this fertility of their Soil, as hath been before obServed, to the Nile, whoSe waters are SuppoSed, among other things, to reposit large quantities of nitre on the m'OLind when it overflows the lands.

What monuments of power, magnificence, riches,. Science, and antiquity, does Egypt yet shew us, in the ruins of its pyramids, obelilks, _ labyrinths, and other publick buildings.

Egypt, at the beginning, had native kings, who governed their Subjects with a free and unlimitted authority, and till the government of Renmmenitas, Son of Amasis, who ruled in the year of the world 3454, were all called by one general sirname, or title of Pharaoh, being a name of dignity, as with us the name of emperor or king is. But though Egypt has been for many ages governed by kings, yet the royal Seats have been changed. The first royal Seat we read of was Tanis, where the court of that Pharaoh, mentioned in Scripture, was held. Thebes was alSo a royal Scat; then Memphis, which was the Seat of the kings, of the race of Coptus, until Ne-buchadonozer Sacked it. Alexandria was alSo a royal Seat, where the Greek kings resided for 900 years, till the Arabians took Egypt, and made Testat, near Old Cairo, the metropolis. After Gianber had built Cairo, about the year of the * Kegira 362, he made that the royal Seat,

Baron Holberg, sh his introdndlion to Universal History, justly obServes of E-gypt, that it is particularly worthy of admiration, on account of the very great number of its inhabitants, the many arts that were cultivated among them, the great fertility of the land, and their stupendous edifices.
The walls of the city of the Sun, which I have mentioned before, by the name of' Thebes, were 140 * furlongs in circumference. Bufiris, its founder, adorned it with many magnificent buildings, and other ornaments ; and Several other kings who Succeeded him, added greatly to its magnificence, particularly by eredting statues and large obelisscs, of one entire stone. So that there was not a city on the earth So richly adorned as this. The grandeur of this city, in other reSpedts, may, in Some Sort, be determined from a consideration of its gates, which were loo in number.

It has four sides, each containing Seven acres ; the whole area of this pyramid covers a Space of more than eleven acres. The north Side meaSures 693 feet,, the perpendicular height is 493 feet, the real aS-cent is equal to the diameter of the baSe, or 693 feet; 360,000 men were employed in this work, which they Scarcely com-pleated in 20 years.
But permit me to return to their government, and take a short view of the various changes the state underwent.
CambySes, the Son of Darius, in the year of the world 3454, was the first that made the Egyptians stoop to a foreign yoke ; he, with a strong army, invaded and conquered Egypt, took PSammenitus: captive, put him to death, committed very great destniclion, and reduced the country into a province. It remained in Subjeftion to the Persians above 150 years, until the reign of Ataxerxes Longima- -nus, in whoSe time the Egyptians Set up Inarus, Son of PSammenitus before king of Libya, who governed happily till Ar-taxerxes, with a great fieet, and a large
body

body of men, came upon them, out of Phcenicia unexpectedly, and Soon reduced them again to his obedienee ; from which time it was Subject to the Persian kings, until the reign of Darius Nothus, when they were expelled by Amirteus born in the city, of Sais, or Pelusium, now Ca-iixerne.
'	Amirteus reigned six years, and then
for about 91 years was Suceedeed by four MendiSian princes, after that by three Se* bonites, until Nedtabanes the Second, in whole time Artaxerxes Ochus bereaved him of his kingdom, and So Egypt fell again into the hands of the Persians, to whom it continued Subject till the de-llru-ftion ot ]3arius Codornanus, by Alexander tliC Great, who brought it ,to the Grecian, or Macedonian kings, that reigned live vcaiis over it; after Alcxan,-ders death, it fell to Ptoiomeus, sir-named Lvagiis, whence all the kings, his fucceffors in that kingdom, were called Pcolornies, adding to that of Fcolomy fome other name.
You know this Ptolomy the first of that name, was one of Alexander’s generals ; and after Alexander’s fudden death, when empires and kingdoms fell 10 the C 6	lots,
M E M O I R S of
lots of the brave and the bold, he pof-Seffed himSelf of Egypt, and there came after him nine other kings, who bore the name of Ptolomy.	i
The race of the Ptolomies unhappily ended with Cleopatra, the daughter of	,
Ptolomy Auletes, courted at first by Ju-	i
lius Cxfar, and afterwards by Mark An-	j
thony, through whofe favours she kept her Sovereignty ; but Augustus, at the battle of Aclium, ruining Anthony’s fortunes with the death of Cleopatra, who poiSoned herSelf, made it a Roman province, and it continued under that em-	^
pire, till the reign of Heraclitus, who	j
held his royal court at Constantinople.	1
After the dividing of the Roman empire	'
into eastern and western, Egypt fell to the Greek, or western share, till the Egyptians Submitted to the Arabian caliphs, about the year 704, to whom they re-	l
mained faithful till conquered by the	|
Mahometans. In the year 1155, Syra-con, or Xarracon, by others Alerddin, Schyrachocsh, an Armenian general, or prime Vizier of the king Damas, by his	!
victorious arms, took captive the Caliph	;
of Egypt, and made himSelf master there, with the title of Sultan, or Souldan; and
it
,	Mr. Charles Guildford. 37
it continued in that name and race, till the year 1242, when the Mamalucks, the offspring of a people, on the banks of the Euxine Sea, mercenary Soldiers,, kept in the pay of the Sultan, by the murder of their lord, made themSelves masters of the country, under the tyranny of whoSe race and possession it groaned from 1255, until the year 1517.
The last Sultan of Egypt, who was called Tomumbey, the Second of that name, and who was eledled Sultan by the Mamalucks having wars with the Turkish emperor Selim, was defeated by him, and fied to Cairo, where he was taken captive, and delivered up by a Moorish prince. This happened in the year 1517, when j	he was miSerably murdered, his body
tied to the tail of a camel, and then dragged through Cairo. This vidlory, gained by Selim, So ruined the power of the Mamalucks, that Egypt hath ever since been Submitted to the Turks.
When I consider the history of theSe people, and of many other states, particularly the Mexican, I cannot help pitying the unhappy people greatly, to think a state, like that of Egypt, or that of Mexico, under the government of their
Incas
3^ M E M O I R S of

Even the fate of a single perfon, the monarch’s I mean, is shocking. Tliink of the fate of Toniumb-ey, after reigning as fovereign, over an extensive and very famous nation, every delight, every plea-fure fubfervient to Iiis wist, and thoiifands of people his fiibjests at his conmiand,

There is not, however, now above fifteen thoufand, at the most, of theSe people left, millions of them having been put to the Sword, partly by the Pagan Emperors for their adhering to the Christian faith, and partly by the Christian Emperors, for their obstinacy in maintaining the opinion of DioScorus, one of their Patriarchs, concerning one nature, one will, and one perSon in JeSus Christ. It is observed in history, that a governor under the emperor Dioclesian, maSfacred, in one night, at Christmas, 80,000, who were buried at Mount Achnim, in the Upper Egypt; and, at another time, near ISna, the Same, or another governor, put to death So many, that they could not be numbered.

things, tv/o hundred thouSand volumes of manuscripts, fell a SacriSice to war. There were alSo a prodigious number of. books in the library at Alexandria, which were unfortunately lost when Julius Cteiar made war there.
You know the Egyptians were famous for arts and learning. The invention of arithmetick, geometry,''physic, &c. is attributed to them, for which reaSon Egypt is called the Mistrefs of Arts. From thence Pythagoras and Democritus, learned their philoSophy, and Lycurgus, Solon, and Plato, their forms ot government. Here fiourishecl the learned grammarian Arif-tarchus ! Herodian and Didymus, So well Skilled in Sciences; Appianns the hiSto-I	rian, C. Ptolomeus the geographer, TriS-
‘	megistus the philoSopher, and many others
of equal note.
One of the most remarkable things in I	Egypt is, the vast quantities of Salt year-
i	ly made at the Salt pits and cisterns near
Alexandria, from the water of the Nile, which is, in itSelf, the Sweetest and the freshest in the Vvorld, and yet yields a very excellent Salt, having the taste of violets. This quality proceeds from the ni-I	irons eartii; for if a piece of it be laid in

the Sun, it will become as v/hite as Snow ' on that side which is expoSed to the Sun; they make So much Salt as to produce yearly eighteen thouSand French crowns.
Strabo, of old, divided Egypt into thirty-Seven parts, by the Greeks called Monoi; Pcolomy enlarged it to 40 ; and Herodotus reduced it to 28, But 37 Seems most agreeable to the mysterious temple or labyrinth (on the Ibuth fide of the city of Alexandria, near the lake Me-reotis, and adjoining to the Sepulchres of King Metis, and his wife) in the midst whereof were 37 palaces belonging to the 37 juriSdidions of Egypt, whereof 10 were in Thebes 10 in Delta, and 17 in the middle region, unto v^^hich reSorted the Several presidents, who had there their particular temples to celebrate the festivals of them gods. There were alSo 15 - chapels, containing each a Nemesss, to ad-vife of matters of importance concerning the general welfare.
I, in one of my former letters, mentioned our stopping at a place on the Red Sea; I believe it was Suez, but am not (Certain. Idsts fea is by others called the Arabian gulph, and is more properly a gulph than a fea. It siaweth out of the
Indian
44 M E M O I R S of
Indian ocean, between Aden, a town in Arabia, and Cape Mufiedon in Africa, having Africa on the west, and Arabia on ■ the east. It runs to the eastward as far as the Isthmus of Africa, to the town of Suez, where there is a harbour for the Turkish fleet, and receiveth only a few * frnall rivers, but not one out of Africa.
It is extended from the South east to the north west ; its form is oblong. Iste most probable opinion why it is called the Red Sea is, that it came to be So called from the red Sand that lies upon the shore, and IS often mixed with the water by the violent flux and reflux of the Sea, which is extraordinary in this gulph, inSomuch that it toffes it backwards and forwards like ashes, and keeps it from falling to the bottom by its violent agitation ; this is related by thoSe who have been there, who farther add, that it Sometimes appears as red as blood, but if it be kept in a veS-Sel without shaking, the red Sand will Subside, and may be Seen in the bottom. It very often happens, that violent storms blowing from the Red Sea, towards Arabia, or Africa, carry with them Such heaps of red Sand, as to cover whole caravans, or troops of men and beasts, whoSe bodies.

dies, in time, are thus converted into true mummy. As to Suez, which I have mentioned above, it does not contain above two hundred houSes, with a bad port, and yet it is the Turks arSenal upon the Red wSea. The haven is Small and shallow, for neither gallics nor ships can enter into it, till they are half unladen, which is the reafon that most of the vessels lie in the road, where they are more Secure than in the port. The governor keeps two Small galiies, and Some other vessels, to maintain his authority in the Red Sea. The commodities of the East Indies were heretofore brought thither, and then conveyed into Europe ; but the Turks do not, at preSent, enjoy that commerce, becauSe the Christians have now many Settlements in the Indies. The ships Set out from Suez in the Spring and Summer, when the north wind blows, the South winds being most constant in winter and autumn.
I have one more thing to notice before I quit Egypt, and then I believe I shall proceed to a different Subjed. SeSostris, Darius, and other kings of Egypt, have attempted to cut a channel between the Red Sea and the Nile, that out of the Indian
46 M E M O I R S of
dian-Ocean and through the Red-Sea, they might fail that way from the mouth of the Nile into the Mediterranean, which would be of great advantage to Egypt and other countries upon the coast of the Mediterranean. But history Says they were forced to desist from this enterprize be-cauSe the Red-Sea was discovered by the artificers, to be much higher than the Inner Egypt. And its farther Said that	’
other kings of Egypt of old, and of late the Egyptian Sultans, and Turkish emperors, had frequent conSultations about cutting through that Istmns that joins Africa to Asia, and Separates the Mediterranean from the Red-Sea; but it is further observed, that the reaSon why they did not proceed was, that the Indian and Red-Sea were found to be much higher than the shores of the Mediterranean: and therefore it was feared that the Red-Sea would overflow them, eSpedally Egypt, which is reckoned by every one to be a very low country,
Vareriius is of a different opinion, and thinks political reaSons prevented them from carrying any design of that kind into execution, viz. expence, infinite labour
I
Mr. Charles Guildford. 47
hour, many difficulties, a prodigious tradb ■of rocky ground to go through, and above all, their fear that the Christian states would by various means receive much greater advantage from it than they them-Selves, and deprive the Grand Seignor of considerable revenues arising from goods conveyed by a land carriage, &c. And farther still, that the Christians, who excel them in navigation, might invade thoSe countries, or even Medina itSelf, the Sepulchre of Mahomet.. For a considerable fleet would in a short time tranSport a great army of men, and all manner of provisions from Europe to Arabia, by Such a canal.
But now my friend I have done with Egypt. I return to our own adventures.
We were as I before obServed to you, confined cloSe priSoners, during the stay we made at the place which I have before mentioned on the Red-Sea, from what reaSon we could not conjedture, unleSs for fear we should by Some means get out of our purchasers power, who had not bought us fairly, i. e. we were not properly the property of thoSe that fold us.
As we had no entertainment, and as our confinement was very irkSome, you
may
\
4« M E M O I R S of	!
may be affured we studied for every entertainment we could think of, to amuSe ourSelves. This could only consist in con-verlation. As is uSual in Such circumstances, a part of our entertainment was a relation of each other’s adventures, for Such they might be called.
Omar gave us Some account of his family, and of hirnSelf, and as the history I	is but short and contains a good moral, I
shall beg leave to give it to you, and wish your entertainment may equal that which we received in hearing it.
I	Omar came from Ifphan, or Spahawn,
the metropolis of Persia, which was the place of his' birth, and where he had received a part of his education, the rest had been compleated in his travels, which I	had been very extensive.—He was really
an accomplished youth.—His heart. Such as I could wish it, and his perSon really I	fine, though diSguiSed under a Slaves ha- ‘ .
bit.
His father was a man of genteel fortune, learned, and very curious. This made him. fond of every foreigner of learning and merit, that ever came to Ispahan, or that he ever met with in the courSe of his travels, for he had been a I	very
i
Mr. Charles Guilford. 49
very great traveller, and had Spent large Sums of money, during his residence in foreign parts in Searching into, and learning of various arts and Sciences.
When his father fettled at iSpa-ban, his fortune was greatly reduced, but being one of the principal perSons in the place, and having a large Sliare of learning and merit, he was Soon married to a beautiful young lady, of a good family and a very large fortune. This again established him, and enabled him to purSue his studies with fresh vigour and' Spirit. He Soon expended a considerahle part of his lady’s fortune in the pnrfuits of knowledge, and in educating Omar and a Sister, that were the fruit’s of his father’s marriage. His houSe then became a common receptacle for men of learning of almost every profession, and particularly the liberal arts.
His lady was an accomplished woman and Superintended, in a great meaSurc, her daughters education. During Omar’it infancy a German was introduced to the father as a man of profound knowledge, particularly in chymistry, and who understood the nature of minerals in general, ex-tremiely well, and what were the princi-

■	LETTER, V.
I PROCEED according to the promiSe I made in my last.
The German insinuated himSeif into the ■father’s favour, who found he was a man poffeffed of a prodigious fund of knowledge. The German at last informed the old gentleman, that he had employed a great part of his time in examining into the naturfe of metals.
He alledged that all metals, consist of two principles, viz. Mercury, as the basis, or m.atter, and Sulphur as the cement: st	the first the SubStratum, or metalline mat-
ter; the Second, which renders it fixed
and
I
Mr. Charles Guildford. 51
tmd malleable. That the Mercury was the Same as common quicksilver, only more clear and .pure, the fulphur a, peculiar Sort of matter, Specially denominated Sulphur of metals, and Said by Homberg and ether modern chymists to be light, or fire.
That, this being united with the Mercury, fixes it; and according to the different degrees of union and coherence I	therewith, produces different metals.
That Homberg by retaining Mercury, a long time in a moderate fire, had ob-*> taineci gold from it, and from thence inferred that gold consists of a Sulphurous or igneous part; and a heavy mercurial part fixed thereby : and that by only taking away the Sulphurous, or fiery part of the gold, it is reduced to running Mercury. I'hat as to the gravity of gold, and its being heavier than Mercury, both Mr. Boyle and Mr. Homberg had demonstrated that the particles of fire or light were heavy, and their insinuating themSelves into the pores of the Mercury and there fixing; increaSed its Specific gravity. And concluded, by affuring ^ the old gentleman that metals were tranS-mutable into one another, and in short D 2	that
52 M E M O 1 R S of
that he very well understood the proceSs and could absolutely change pure Mercury into pure gold.
That just as he had made himSelf maS-ter of this invaluable Secret, and procured a Small quantity of gold worth about five hundred pounds, it was discovered, and he was obliged to fly from his native country on that account. That he had travelled about from place to place, but had not yet determined where to fix his residence! and that now his money, arising from his gold, wasalmost gone, and he could not renew his proceSs without Some expensive materials, and Some 'conveniences which he could not procure, and that he likewise wanted the assistance of a man of learning and good SenSe, free from all prejudice, to go through the procefs with him, and assist him therein.
That were thefe things done he did not make the least doubt but that he should ityon acquire a Sufficient fund, both for himSclf and his assistant, to sit down contented for life and let the art dye with him, as was it publickly known, it would be as publickly followed, and the value I	of that precious metal, would decreaSe So
! '	aS'yjiot to be v/orth the starching after.

Mr. Charles Guildford. 53
Omar’s father was ambitious.	He
knew the value of gold, and the insiuen.ee it had.	T he German’s relation rouSed
Some ambitious thoughts in his mind that had for Sometime lain dormant. He thought if he could poffeSs this glorious shcret, he could raiSe himSelf and his family to Some of the greatest dignities in the kingdom, by making them the richest Subjedls.
After he had Several days conSideredon what the German had Said, he determined to join with him, and give him all the assistance he could ; not doubting but that the German would communicate the Secret, in consideration of the Services and / assistance the old gentleman intended to promiSe him. We muft do justice to Omar’s father, by observing, that he intended to enter heartily into the German’s Scheme, to join their united forces, and let the profits, arising from their labours, be equally divided between them, in a fair and honest manner, and to compleat the whole he intended to betroth his young daughter to this German, who he was Satisfied would in a short time be a very rich man.
Dj	ge
54 M E M O I R S of
He carried the first part of his design into execution, and Soon after communicated the whole of his plan to the German, who after taking the fame into consideration, not cliusing to comply in too hasty a manner, without mature deliberation, at length required three days to consider of his friends propofal. This very request confirmed the old gentleinan, in the good opinion he had formed, of his German friend.
But his lady who had overheard their convcrfation, and who knew more of the I	world than her hushand, who had not
studied men fo much as books, for the first time, in a mild manner remonstrated to him the uncertainty attending fuch a design, the expence, and that if it should not fucceed, it must inevitably ruin his family.
Her remonstrances greatly furpfmed him, and he was a little irritated, but however fuppreffing his difpleafure, he difmiffed her, with informing her that he had not fpent fo many years in study, not i j to know what he was about, that should it Succeeditwouldbeof infinite fervicetothe family, and should it not, he would fpend but little in the proceSs, as his regard for I	her
1
Mr. Charles Guildford. 55
her and his children, was too great to Suffer him to injure them, in an article of Such conSequence, and therefore desired her as a proof of her regard for him, to obServe the most profound Silence on this occasion, and to make herSelf perfeftly _ eaSy, and place an entire confidence in his prudence.
.	The poor lady was obliged to Submitj
she duiit not Say any more, and even iit' faying what she had, Ihe depended on his; very great regard for her, other wife She might by Such a step have rendered the rest; of her life miserable. O my friend \: the Persian ladies are not So happy, as the English ones. Our fair country womendd not know hov/ Superior their situation is, to the most magnificent of theSe ladies, I'hey poffeSs the Same fitare of freedom and libertv as their hushands, and have almost :as much pov/er, many of thent more. On the contrary the Perfian and Turkish ladies, and in fash the ladies of many other natisms, have fcarce any will of their own, but are fubmitced to the tyrannical powTr of their lordly hiilbands, in the most abjesh manner.
/	. But to return to m^ history. The
German at the end of the three days, after D 4	a
S6 M E M O I R S of
a very long introduction, and professing the greatest regard ior Omar’s father, from whom he acknowldged, he had received many favours,' agreed to enter into the design, according to the plan laid down by his worthy friend.
After they had entirely Settled their plan, they proceeded to the execution of it, on which they entered with thegreatt est Spirit. The German Subscribed a Smiall Sum towards purchasing the necessary materials which w'as all he could Spare, the old gentleman Subscribed above twice as much.
The German undertook to buy vrhae was necessary, and it was agreed that the proceSs should be carried on at Omar’s hoLiSe, and that the German should there take up'his rcSiclence, that he might more constantly and with greater eaSe attend the proceSs. This the German, in appearance, with reluDance conSented to, as being unwilling to become an incumbrance to his friend.
The German now provided a great variety oS materials, of various kinds, whoSe uSes and applications on this occasion even puzzled, the old gentleman. They were
Mr. Charles Guildford. 57
at length ready and began their proceSs, and now their hopes encreaSed.
They with eager expedlation attended, and at last to the very great joy and Surprize of the old gentleman, a little gold was produced as a Specimen, tried and found pure, and of Superior value to any he had ever Seen.
What was the old man’s joy, at the sight of this all-powerful metal?
“ Gold! yellow, glittering, precious “ gold!
“ Gold! that will make black, white t.
“ foul, fair; wrong, right:
** BaSe, noble; old, young; coward, va-“ Slant!
“ Hal you gods! why this “ Will lug your priests, and Servants ‘Cf cm your sides,
“ Pluck stout mens pillows from below “ the‘r heads ’
^ This yellow stave
“ Will knit and break religions: blefs the accurj’d:
“ Make the hoary leproSy ador’d: placs thieves,

# ,
'	5^ M E M O I R S of
And give them title, knee, and appro^
“ bation,
“ With Senators on the bench..	i
Thus Says ShakeSpear, in his Timon of Athens, and Garth Speaks well to the fame purpoSe, when he Says,^
“ Gold makes a patrician of a stave ;
“ A dwarf anatlaSs; a TherSites brave;
“ It cancels all defefts.
“ It guides the fancy and directs the
“ mind;	'
No bankrupt ever found a fair-one “ kind.
The old gentleman v/ith inexpressible joy, runs to his lady and shews her the precious metal, exulting at the Superiority of his judgement over her’s, when he had now gainvd this convincing proof.
The lady viewed it, then modeftly aSk-ed if that was all, and how much it had cost. The old gentleman was dissatisfied with the question. But being good na« tured, only gently chid her, for being • still dubious, and then told her it was only a Specimen not the Sole fruits of their labour and expence. That he did not

Mr. Charles Guildford. 59
in ihe least doubt, but a short time would produce Sassicient to convince her and amply reward them for all their pains
I	and expenre. That he would then with
a great part of the gold produced piir-chaSe a much larger stock of materials, enlarge their works rnd in a short time make a very great addition to their wealth; that when he was as rich as he wished, he would employ his interest at court, and likewise his gold, in behalf of his friend,
liimSelf and his Son, and------The lady
begged he would be kind enough to stop there, and not think of that ’dil he had first obtained the principal point.,
Omar was startled at this, considered a moment, and then Said, I h.ivtt been rav-.

To this his lady anSwered, she esteem-	1
ed his behaviour on this occasion, as a fresh proof of his regard for her, and only desired he would aft with caution, and not engage too deeply until he was certain the SucceSs of the proceSs, would an-wer for their labour and expence.
Omar in anSwer to this assured her he would punctually follow her advice, and once more repeated his desire to her, that she would make herSelf perfeftly caly.
He returned to the German. The German knew Omar intended to betroth his daughter to him. He had therefore exerted himSelf with uncommon care arid assiduity. When Omar returned, he had produced more gold, in short the process*
.being ended, the gold produced w'as almost double in value to the expences of the principal materials.
' The old gentleman on Summing up the account was So overjoyed that his friend the German was obliged to detain him fometime by force, in the room were he then was, for fear he should commit fomc extravagant act, and thereby drScover the whole of their proceedings. However ,, when he grew more calm, he conSented
that
!
Mr. Charles Guildford 6i
that the affair should be discovered to his lady ; but cautioned him not to exaggerate too much, &c.
The old gentleman according to his friends advice informed his lady of their SucceSs, in a more moderate manner than he had done before, and as a proof of what he laid produced the golden harvest of their labours.
She was now herSelf prodigiouOy Surprized, and from Such a convincing proof of the German’s abilities, formed a far more favourable opinion of him than she had hitherto entertained.
She had before stron ly oppoSed her hulband, in his design of betrothing their daughter to the German, which v:as the only reaSon why it had been delayed : she now a.^ readily came into the Scheme, and desired it might be done without loSs of time, least the German, who had before esteemed himSelf honoured in the intended alliance, being now enabled to repeat his proceSs, v/ithout Omar’s affiance, should change his mind.
That I may not extend this letter, to too great a length, I will stop here and conclude my Self, yours Sincerely,

TH E old gentleman and his lady de-	,
liberated Seriousty on this affair. O-mar had often refiedled on what his lady had Said, relative to the German ; another thought likewise made him rather uncertain how to ad, and that was owing to his tenderneSs for his infant daughter, who was not capable of making a choice for herfelf, and when ambition did not influence him, his humanity and parental af-fedion prevailed, and he could not readily conSent to the facrificing her to in-	i
terested views. Thefe considerations determined him to wait, at least, till they had tried the Succcfs of a repetition of their proceik He made ufe of his uSual plea to the German for not fulfilling his pro-mife, that his lady yet oppofed it, but that he believed he (hould foon gain her conSenf, for that their fucceSs had greatly interested her in his Savour.
Omar then communicated his design to the German of repeating the procefs, but first to enlarge their works, and buy a much larger quantity of materials, that the produce arising from their labours might be lb much the greater.	As
j
I	f
i •	■	' ■
Mr. Charles Guildford.
As to renewing the proceSs, the German readily conSented to it, but oppoSed ‘	the enlarging the works till they were more
experienced, and to enforce his argument alledged, that in the last proceSs, he had made Some observations that oave him ve-ry great pleaSure, and had greatly raiSed his hopes, but that he could not with cer-t	tainty depend on the observations he had
made till he had repeated the proceSs, that he should, in the Second proceSs, renew his observations, and attend more circum-Spedlly to Some particular parts of the proceSs, than he had before done, and it might turn out to great advantages.
Omar was Satisfied with theSe reaSons, when the German, not to leave him any longer in doubt, produced a Sinall paper of powder, and informed Omar, that during the proceSs, the first Specimen of gold was produced, and whilst he was abSent, he had mixed Some of that powder, about as much as he had then in his hands, with the materials, as believing it would not only expedite the proceSs, but alfo add greatly to the pureneSs and quantity of the gold, they should extract; that he believed it had Succeeded, but did not think proper at first to mention it, fearing
he
K
64 M E M O I R S of
he might raiSe his friend’s expedations too high, and afterwards diSappoint him. I'hat he would once more make the experiment, and to gain certainty, would carry on the proceSs in Several crucibles, in each of which should be an equal quantity of the materials necessary ; and that into two of them he would put an equal quantity of that powder, when the proceSs was in proper order for its reception, and then they would Soon have occular demonstration whether this powder would anSwer their expedations, and the trouble, expence, and time required, for the making of it. Fcr he obServed, that it was compoSed of Several ingredients, that were dear ; that it was long in making, and required a great deal of care and art to bring it to perfection, but that he was well acquainted with’ the proceSs, and had Several times m.ade it: that though they should want new materials for the making it, &c. and though it was attended with expence and trouble, yet it would richly pay tor the whole, should it anSwer in their next proceSs. That then they would immediately prepare for the making of it, and alSo greatly enlarge their former works, buy a large quantity of materials,
' and
I
Mr. Charles Guildford. -65
and in two or three processes at most, richly repay themlclves for all their labour, trouble, and expence.
The German, had never, till now, been in appearance w^armed with the fiicceSs of their labours, never had he exulted at the proSpedl of growing rich ; never had he prqmiled msuch, but always appeared cool and tranquil. Now he Seemed to Speak with peculiar pleaSure, and his joy appeared on his countenance, at the proSpedt their future labours Seemed to promiSe them.
Omar looked on this as a certain omen of the most glo ious SucceSs, and embra* cing him with the greatest demonstrations of joy and friendship, told him he should command both him and his; that he should be certain of his daughter if he approved of her, and that he would in every thing, be, for the future, guided by his Superior knowledge ; that whatever ' the expences were, that attended Such a glorious undertaking, he did not regard it, but would chearfully Support it to the utmost extent of his fortune.
The German professed himSelf obliged, and received this declaration of kindneSs '	with all the modest diffidence natural to
a man
X	-
66 MEMOIRS of
a man of learning and merit, but who is not vain of his accomplishments. 'I'his	,
still Served to confirm the old gentleman, '	!
that it vv’as this very individual man who was to make the fortunes of him and hjs family, and as Such he was determined he would esteem and treat hi 111 . shdiey ^gain purchaSed materials, and again repeated their proceSs with the variations the German had propoSed. But ye gods ! v/hen the powder was tried, and the old gentleman Saw it Succeed to their utmost wishes, v/hat v/as his joy ?, It was inexpressible ! For which reaSon I stiail not attempt to delineate it.
The German had now, by this Second proof of his shill, entirely gained possession of his heart, and he would have Sacrificed, in the first transports of his joy, not only his infant daughter, but even all his family, to the Service of the German, who had discovered every part of the proceSs, not only of producing Gold, but alSo of making the powder to expedite the pro-I	ceSs, and increaSe the quantity of the Gold
they were in quest of.
The German embraced the happy moment: both the old gentleman and his lady were now as much his friends as he
could
Mr, Charles Guildford. 67
could wish, and the young Sophia was betiothed to him'in the most Solemn manner, and thereby his v/ishes cornpleated. I’he old gentleman, immediately on the betrothing of his daughter, paid the German a large Sum, amounting to near half of what he was then worth, as a portion with his daugliter, and v:as like wife very-liberal in his promises, to his betrothed Son-in-law.
Omar did not doubt but he should now . be Soon enabled to make a very genteel provision for his Son, as well as for hsim-Self and his lady, tec. in fast his head was* full of golden dreams and the moft glorious hopes'. He was every thing he could wish in idea. Well, the contrast over, and the German now esteemed as one of the family, they, by his desire, rest a little from their labours, take their pleaSure, and, after Some time Spent aC home, make a tour over different parts of the country, to amuSe and improve theni' Selves. Masters, tec. are provided at home for the compleating the education of the young Omar and his Sister Sophia ; the old gentleman determines they shall both have the most liberal education he can give them, particularly his Son,
whom

whom he flattered himSdf he should, in a few years. See the Sha’s Athemat Doulet, i. e. the Emperor’'s prime minister in tern- >	'
poral affairs, and that probably he himSelf ’ might be made Seobre, i. e. principal or high priest. The family lived happily, gaily, and merrily for Some time, till at length the old gentleman begins to think it is time to purSue their former labours, and put it out of the pov/er of fortune to disappoint them.
They renew their works accordingly, purchaSe proper utensils and materials, i	not only for the enlarging of the gold pro-
i	cels, but alSo for the making of the cu-
!	rious powder I have mentioned before.
I	Every thing being at length ready for
making of the powder, they begin, and the old gentleman clofely attends the^pro-ceSs of making it, not having before Seen I	it, and being very desirous of learning it
pradicably, for fear any.accident should happen to the generous German, who permitted him to attend, whilst he employed himSelf in colledling of other ma-I	terials, and preparing for their fiiture ope-
rations, and Sometimes taking a little relaxation from the fatigues of Such laborious wo.k. Every thing Seemed to go on in a
very

very fair, but very How manner, till the old gentleman began to be a little impatient ,	to finish the powder, that they might pro-
ceed to the grand work. The German particularly charged him to be cautious in the prefent proceSs, and very patient, for that he had not yet gone through the half of what was recpuisite for the making of the powder properly ; this was very disagreeable news for Omar, and he, for the first time appeared angry with his Son-in-law, for ever engaging in the making of it, when they could have done without it^ only by having more patience.
The German anfwered, it was the very thing he wanted, for if he could now ^ exercife his patience a little, and willing- ” ly Submit, he would not again meet with So disagreeable a talk. The old gentleman, on considering his Son-in-law’s argument, and that the other proceSs, without the assistance of the powder, was very flow ; and that this powder, when made, would remove that diSagreeable part of the proceSs, and, perhaps.

man continued to attend this stow powder proceSs till his patience was once more tired out, and he began to be angry with the German for not attending a little doSer himSelf than what he had hitherto done. The German did not Seem to like this impatience of his father-in-law, and, in a half angry tone, told him, he was not uSed to Such work, or elSe he would think nothing of the attendance ; and alledged, that he had attended three times as long before he could compleat the proceSs. That he would, however, as he was So impatient, haSten it, and he must take the conSequences, which the German accordingly-did, the old gentleman very readily resigning the care of it to him, and not much caring what became of the powder, knowing, let the worst happen that could, it might be diSpenSed vdth, and that it was only making a leSs quantity of gold at a time, and continuing the TroceSs a little longer.
The German, however. Some few days after informed him, he had com pleated the powder, and that they would now re-I	new their other proceSs, and make at once

again for a considerable time, not till their I	own

own inclinations led them to it for employment. In conSequence of this laud-ble resolution, they prepared all their materials that they had purchaSed, and began their proceSs. And here you must permit me* to leave Omar and his Son-in-law till my next. I Subscribe mySelf,

LETTER VII.
Y N my last I informed you, that Omar and his Son-in-law, had made grand preparations for a golden harvest, and a rich one they expetsted. The old gentleman’s hopes were now raiSed to the highest, and he, in a short time, expected to be worth more money than all he had hitherto Spent, since he had been his own master. He, from day to day, attended the proceSs, with piercing greedy eyes, until the day arrived, when the gold, according
72 M E M O I R S of
cording to their calculations, would begin to appear, which happened according to their expedlations, and greatly rejoiced the old gentleman. This was the time for putting in the powder, and therefore he immediately cried out to the German, ‘ Put in the powder put in the powder ! The German obeyed, a proper quantity was put into each vessel, and instantly the gold, that began to appear, vanished, and with it all their hopes.
The German, in a frantic manner, exclaimed, ‘ We are ruined! v/e are un-‘ done.; The old gentleman looked aghast and pale with fear. It was with the utmost difficulty and with a trembling voice, he cried, ‘ What’s the matter ?’ To this the German replied, that the powders had ruined all their hopes, by Spoiling the whole of their materials, just as the gold was coming to perfedtion. The old gentleman, with equal difficulty to that with which he ashed his first queStion, enquired the reaSon why The reaSon is, replied the German, your excessive impatience in attending the proceSs for making the powder, and obliging me to hasten it, by *	which I lost my calculation, and could
not properly regulate the proceSs. And is
all
'
Mr. Charles Guildford. 73
all our labour, in, both processes lost ? Says Omar. That it certainly is, fays the German, and we must begin again. At theSe words the old gentleman dropped backwards, lay motionleSs for Some time, till recovered by the friendly assistance of the German, v/hen he stamped on the floor, tore his cloaths, and even his hair, through vexation, and would certainly have committed Some deSperate a6l, had he not been prevented by the German, and by him affured, that they might yet recover Some gold out of theSe materials, viz. that which had at first appeared, and which might, perhaps, pay them the cxpences they had been at, in theSe pre“ parations. This was Some little comfort for the old gentleman ; they immediately applied to their fires, enlivened them, did all they could to perfedl their imperfedt work, and in a few hours produced a fmall quantity of gold, which, on fettling
I	their accounts, did not clear a fourth part
of their expences. They had nothing now to do, but to renew their procefs, and endeavour to make therrdelves amends for this disappointment.
The question now was, whether they should renew the powder proceSs, or im-E	mediately
74- MEMOIRS of
mediately proceed to the gold proceSs without it. The old gentleman was here undetermined; he would have begun both at the Same time, but they required So much attendance, as to render it impossible for them to bring either to perfection ; he had before Seen, in the Second experiment they had made, the Surprizing effe<5l‘ of the powder, and tvas very well convinced^ that if they could bring it to perfedlion, it would make him ample a-mends for all his trouble ; that the proceSs, wsithout the pov/der, was very tedious, and did not yield any thing like the quantity of gold, as it did when Supplied with the powder. In short, after maturely weighing each alternative in his own I	breast, he determined to repeat the pro-
I	ceSs for making the powder, and for that
I	purpoSe to enlarge their works, that they
might make a treble quantity, as it would not require any more trouble or time, comparatively Speaking, than to make a ,	* third part of the quantity he now intend-
ed to make. He communicated this de-j	termination to his Son-in lav/, who highly
applauded his judgment. The old gen-:	Tleman, however, desired he w^ould assist
I I	in the taking upon him an equal part, at
i '	least,

leasts of the attendance, which the German readily conSented to ; and-having prepared every thing necessary for this proceSs, at a pretty large expence, notwithstanding the frugality and oeconomy of the German, who had taken upon him-Self the care of buying every thing neceff Sary, the old gentleman liberally contributing his quota of the expence, they once more began their procels for the
I making of their powder.
Sometimes the old gendeman attended the proceSs, Sometimes his Son-in-law, till the old gentleman’s patience vras once more almost dred out. But he durst not now open his nroutlrto make a complaint. At length, however, the proceSs wa» ‘ coinpleated, and the German declared it was the most peifedt he had ever Seen. This was glorious news for the old gentleman, and he was now as much exalted with joy, as he had been before oppressed with grief.
Their gold proceSs was now prepared with the greatest expedition, and every thing Soon got ready. The powder was at length produced, when, O, dire miS-fortune ! on examining their produce, every crucible but a Smali one, was either E 2	fiav^ed
^	76 M E M O I R S of
flawed, broke, or melted. Ten thouSand pities, for the little crucible contained gold Sufficient to defray a fourth part of ail their late expences. The old gentleman on Seeing fuch a glorious crop from So little materials as were put into this crucible,, entertained great hopes, and calculated their late loSs at an immenSe Sum. But as they were now poffeffed of that glorious powder, wffiich he was convinced by this experiment was properly made he did not inthe leaft doubt but that they should, in the next trial, recover all their Ioffes. The gold proceSs, now the powder was ready, would not take up a great length of time to finish, and therefore he determined, that after they had rested themSelves by a relaxation for a short time, as a week or two, they would begin again. In short, the old gentleman, from every new disappointment, Seemed to gain fresh courage, and the greater his disappointment was, the greater was his reSolution to proceed.
The German very readily came into his meafures, but desired they might rest for i	a mont or two, for that it was tlieir im-
patience, was the principal cauSe of all I	their dHappointments j and that had they

proceeded deliberately, and with proper caution^ and had not been too impatient, their last proceSs would, he did not doubt, have Succeeded to their utmost wishes, and have yielded them an immenSe treasure. Whilst the father and his Son-in-law were thus Seeking after immenSe wealth, the young Omar grew up, and was Sent on his travels to gain a.fund of knowledge, equal to the wealth his father intended to give him.
The young Sophia grew up under the care of a very indulgent mother, who endeavoured to form her mind on the most perfedl model. The time drew near when she was to be delivered into the arms of her intended hushand, who waited impatiently for the happy moment that was to give him possession of a young lady woiv thy of a much better fate.
The old gentleman’s finances began to grow low. He Several times called on bis Son-in-lav7 to renew their proceSs, and at length confessed that the education of ' his children, the portion he had given with his daughter, and the expenfive manr-ner in which he had lived for a long time, since their acquaintance, had almost ruined him, and that he must now, through ne-E 3	cessity,
1 .
78 M E M O I R S of
cessity, renew the gold proceSs to Supply
his wants.	4.
The German appeared alarmed at this, he had SuppoSed the old gentleman rich.
He, however, endeavoured to conceal it from his father-in-law’s notice, and promised Soon to indemnify him. The old gentleman had Sufficient penetration to discover that his relation had given the German uneaSineSs, this alarmed him, and yet he knew not why. For as to the gold proceSs he had Several times been an eye witneSs of the gold produced in the fire. But then if his fon-in-law could really by that procefs produce what quantity of gold he pleaSe-d, why need he be uneaSy at his circumstances. Ishey were rich enough to buy materials for feveral processes, and that would immediately recruit his finances.
:	Thefe resseDions cauSed the old gentle-
man to doubt, and that doubt almost drove him into deSpair. He immediate-, ly determined to recal his Son, to defer I	the gold proceSi till he came% and then to
let him as a Spy over the German ; tor when he came to consider, he found, that notwithstanding all the gold produced, he had been a very large Sum out of pocket,
exclu-
Mr. Charles Guildford. 7^
exclusive of the portion he had given with his daughter to the German.
In pursuance of this reSolution, he recalled his Son, and in the mean time founds to his excessive mortification, that as he Said nothing to the German about renewing the proceSs, So the German equalljp ai'oided faying any thing about it, nor did he ever offer to make any preparations for it.
The young Omar Soon returned home, * and his father now intended to put the finishing stroke to his making of gold, and See whether he had hitherto been impoled upon or not. Give me leave here to conclude, and to make the remainder of this history the Subjed of another letter.
Yours,

WELL, my friend, now the grand discovery is going to be made., T he father confesses to his fon, the whole of his proceedings with the German, to the very great astonishment and confusion of the ybunger Omar. But complaints were now fruitleSs; there was still room to hope, from what the father had been iin eye wilneSs to, that Some advantage, might be drawn from the gold proceSs; and though it fiiould not anSwer their most Sanguine wishes,At might enable ' them to live for the preSent, to repeat the procefs from time to time, and by that means privately to raiSe a genteel fubfist-ance. Some time was fpent after the Son’s arrival, before the father propoSed to the German the renewing of the proceSs, be-I	cauSe he would not give his ingenious Son-
;;	in-Lw, any rcaSon to SuSpe6l his inten-
I	tions. Nor did the old gentleman think
i	proper, at first, to retrench his expenSive

!	pendance on his art.
i;i	In the mean time the young Omar vi-
^	fited at the fioule of a widow lady, who.

had married an European, that was lately dead, leaving her possessed of a very ani" pie fortune, and likewiSe two fair daughters, whoSe names were Hacena and Ki-lana ; the widow’s name was Edzerbeina. Having been many years married to ari European, she had imbibed their manners. Omar had often visited the family^ before he lest ISpahan, and during his vi«’ Sits, having free admittance to-the young la lies, who v/ere educated after the manner of the Europeans, and not shut up " from any commerce with mankind, he had though young, contracled a particular fiendiliip for the youngest called Ki-lana. You know the poet Says,
Friendship with woman is neighbour'to “ love.”. ,
And Omar verified' the truth of thofc v/ords; The^ young ladies regard v/as equal to his, vrhidiOmar accidentally discovered by her behaviour, on entering the apartment where she was sitting at work, just after his return to ISpahan, before the young lady knew that he was in that part of the world. This gave him great joy, but that was foon Suppressed,
E 5	v/he
M E M O I R S of
when he refiedled on the wretched circumstances to which he had great reaSon to fear his father would reduce his family. Plowever, whilst in her preSence he endeavoured to banish all melancholy refiedlions, and to appear chearful and eaSy.
His mistreSs alked many questions con-cerning his travels, the places and people he had feen, their laws, customs, and manners, and made Such judicious remarks on many things which he mentioned in the courSe of his relations, that he was greatly pleaSed with her judgment; but the more !	she pleaSed him, the more pain it gave
(	him to think that he must at last be de-
'	prived of a blessing, he had once ssattered
himfelt he should be able to poffeSs.
Edzerbeina perceived the mutual re-,1	gard they had for each other, and was
i	very well pleaSed, as from the figure O-
: •	mar’s father made, she judged he must be
i	possessed of a very extensive fortune, and
therefore she had not the leaSt objection to make to the youth, not doubting but that the father would readily comply with t	shch terms, as she should think proper to
?	demand for her daughter. For this rea-
‘	Son she often invited Omar to her houSe,
and he had always free admittance to the
young
Mr. Charlrs Guildford. 83
young ladies, in the preSence of Edzer-beina. The temptation was too strong for Omar to resist, and he Spent the greatest part of his time at Edzerbeina*s; at last, however, he thought it was proper to bring things at home to a Speedy conclusion, that he might know whether he was to poffeSs the fair Kilana, or not.
He had fixed his refolution of declaring himSelf to Edzerbeina the moment the • grand affair was determined, and, if it Succeeded to afk her conSent, if not to make known his circumstances, and trust to fate for the completion of bis wishes, for he could not bear the thoughts of leaving Edzerbeina any longer in an error with regard to his circumstances. No: he was too generous, even to wish to im-poSe either on her, or the young lady. He applied to his fiither to renew the proceSs. He conSented, Spoke to the German, and told him, he could not Support ^	his expences any longer, and must sty to
that as to his last reSource.
The Gerniab conSented, and they again, as uSual, Set to work. The old gentleman told his Son-in-law, that Omar had* often pressed him to diScover the proceSs, and that with his leave he would, as he E 6	thought
S4 . M E M O I R S of
thought it was a request he could not, in justice, deny him, and that was his own Son, arrived at years of discretion, to request Such a thing, he would not him-Self deny it.
The German conSented, faying, was it only in consideration of their relation to each other, he fiiould readily agree to it. Tliis gave the father and Son very .great pleafure, as they thought it a particular rnaish of his confidence, and a fort of ■proof of the certainty of his art. They proceeded. In short, young Omar attended the German So cloSe, that he, with all his art, could not produce gold.
The German found he was watched, and to evade the punishment due to his I	villainy, fled from the houSe, leaving bis
'	betrothed behind him, but taking with
him the portion the father had given him, and a large Sum of money he had defraud-!	ed the father of, under a pretence of buy-
ing materials for the powder and gold pro-cefles, at ten times a dearer price than what he paid for them. He afterwards Sent a letter privately to inform him, that I	out of generosity to a family he had in-'
j	jured So much., he would aclviSe him not
any longer to endeavour to make gold,

for tliat it was in vain. That distreSs hacl forced him to make uSe of that Scheme, to get a Support. That the gold produced was put into the vessels ; that the first overplus gold was what he had borrowed, and Some of his own, and introduced to g,ain credit ; that he afterwards, by degrees, paid himSelf out of the money allotted for materials, that the crucibles broke, See. in the last experiment were damaged by him ; that the strst powder they made, not Succeeding, v;as only a . finesse ; and that he had, during the cotirfe of their experiments, made Some chemical compositions by which he had railed money to make farther amends for the gold he was obliged to produce to preserve his credit. That to conclude, he had discovered the whole of this affair to prevent him from ruining himSelf and family entirely, by a fruitiefs Search after the art of making gold, and hoped as a reward for Such a Service, he would forgive him, and if he would not permit him to return to his houSe, yet that he would Suffer him to coiisirm his marriage, and let him have his daughter, whom he would take care to maintain with the portion he had been So kind as to give him.

You may, my dear friend, more easily conceive, than I can expreSs, the astonishment this letter cauSed, and the terrible distreSs it threw the whole family into. The father was distracted, and well he might, he had ruined his family. The mother mourned in Silence, avoided reproaching her hushand with his folly, nor ever dropped a hint tending that way, but endeavoured to conSole him as much as "possible for his misfortunes ; this generous behaviour affedted him much more than the most bitter reproaches. The Son was in as bad a Situation as his diSconSo-late father. He imediately fled to Edzer-beina, declared the very great regard he had for her daughter, that his father, by Some unforeseen misfortunes was ruined, and, therefore, as he was now reduced to a state of mifery told her, he must forbear his visits.
Edzerbeina was not So generous as to ' overlook this one circumstance, want of fortune in the worthy Omar, and, therefore, after pitying him for his misfortunes, told him, she could not, consistent with the duty T a parent, that was desirous of feeing her c/Sddren well established in the world, any longer encourage his visits.

This was the finishing stroke that rendered Omar compleatly miserable. It was what he expeded, yet a flattering gleam of hope had occaSionnally shot acrols his gloomy mind, and gave him Some relief,
{	811 Edzeisheina gave the decisive blow.
As to Omar’s Sister, she declared, that the German had been always her aversion ; that she found her parents were both determined she Iliouki marry him ; that she knew her father’s honour was engaged, that they both esteemed it for her interest, had warmly engaged in the design, and Seemed fully bent to compleat it; and therefore fne was determined to yield without the least relufiiance; that she might not give pain to thoSe site So dearly loved, but confessed site should have been unhappy, and that now, with their permission, she would rather stay with them, and share their fate, though ever So wretched, than live in the greatest affluence with the villain, who had been the cauSe of their destrudion. Her parents readily conSented, well knowing the German never durst appear to claim her. As to the father, the refledions he made on his own folly, the Sudden disappointment, and the consideration of his present
88 M E M O I R,S of
lent circumstances, worked So violently on his mind, and So greatly agitated him, that it threw him into a fever, and he died in ten days after this last fatal disappointment. His lady, who before this terrible blow, was Sufficiently unhappy,
■ w'as now wholly overwhelmed with grief, and So great was her distreSs for the loSs of her hushand (for she loved him tenderly) that she could Scarce Support it; however, considering the unhappy situation of her family, and particularly ressecling on her daughter’s youth, beauty, and po-	‘
verty, and not knowing what friends, or enemies, she might meet with, was she deprive:d of her paternal assistance, she determined, for her Sake, to exert herSelf to the utmost, and So bear up against the weight of woe, that, at prefent, fo much oppreffed. her. She Summoned all her fortitude to her assistance,' and nobly did she bear her misfortunes ; that’s the truest virtue my friend ; well, has our inimitable poet Shakefpear expressed him Self on this fubjedt:

As he was passing along with the caravan, they were attacked by a defparate gang of Banditti who took him, and Several others that were forward to engage. This happened Soon after they were got out of the PerSian dominions and had entered Egypt.
Omar was carried about, and exchanged from master to master, till he had tra-verSed great part of Egypt, and at last fell into the hands of the Same fellow who had purchased us.
And thus my friend, I have brought his history down to the time when we became acquainted with him.

But I must now return again to our melancholy history. Our worthy owner fearing we should, make our eScape, as Soon as he had tranSafted his bufinefs, hurried us up the country, a prodigious way, in company with Several other un-happy wretches.
\Ve at length, after many days hard travelling, arrived at Bagdat, a strong-town of Tiirky, on the frontiers of Per-^ fia, fituated on the river Tigris, in the province of Iraca-arable: this town was
formerly
q6 M E M O I R S of
formerly.the capital of the Saracen empire.
The next day alter our arrival at Bag-dat we were Sold to a merchant who dealt in staves. We had now pasted through So many hands, that we could not entertain the least hope of gaining our freedom by any application to magistrates or others, without paying our ranSom, as this last master of ours had certainly fairly bought and paid for us, and this was doubtleSs ' the reaSon of our paSSing thro’ thoSe Several hands, and of being conveyed So far up the country.
* Ishe only hope we now had left was that WT Qiould have liberty of applying to our friends to ranfom us, and that we should not be fo much confined, or fo hardly treated as of late we had been.
' But whether he, vrho Sold us last, had given us the ch:ara6ters of defperate men or not, I cannot tell, but we were clofe-ly guarded, -employed great part of our time in fome fort of labour or other ; and when not employed as clofely confined '	as 'we had been beSore.
A fellow stave who was juft ranlbmed, obtained a paSs to travel with fafety, and Soon left us, intending to go to Grand Cairo. By him, Ofman and I wrote to S	.	the ,
Mr. Charles Guildford. 97
the captain of the vessel, who was to have carried us to Venice, not doubting but he had taken care of our treaSure, and desiring him to remit us bills. The letters our fellow stave promiSed faithfully either to dtliver, or Send by Some Safe conveyance to him, without delay. For .he knew too well the miSeries attending our preSent situfttion, to be in the least dilatory, on Such an occasion.

We now began to be more chearful than vre had ever yet been under our ssa-very. We were Sometimes employed, and Sometimes idle.

The perSon who took our letters had informed him that we had fent for our ranfom’s, in hopes that it would induce him to tfeat us with the greater kindnefs !	»and this, together with our affertions,
had fuch an influence on him, that he granted us our request, did not treat us with fo much feverlty and gave us much greater liberty than we had hitherto en-!	joyed.

Though you are prejudiced, my friend. Says OSman, diredling the first part of his diScourSe to me,*" against Constantinople for the irregularity of our buildings, &c.

It stands in Europe, on a part of the main land, that projedls out towards the Bolphorus of Thrace. On the right hand is the White-Sea, by which there is an
BoSphorus, fignlfies, a narrow fea, or channel, feporating two contiaents, and Serving as a comnuj-1	nication between two Seas. The Bofphorus of

about two paces from the city walls. Not far from this tower is a fountain, to which the Greeks pay a great veneration, and Say wonderful cures have been done by it; near this fountain stands a plcafure houSe of the Bostangi Basha, or overSeer of the gardens.
It is a pavilion covered over, just without the walls of the Seraglio. Beyond this are a great number of cannon placed. So as to strike any Ships that paSs, between wind and water, to hinder their entrance into the Seraglio, or port. TheSe pieces are always charged. But never djScharged

The moSques are»alSo, in general, magnificent, the most famous of which is that of Santa Sophia, which was antiently a Christian-church, built by Justinian, and dedicated to the Wisdom, of God. This fabric is, .	114 paces in length, and 80 in breadth,
and as many high, Square vrithout, but round within. The moSque is very Spacious, with a dome in the middle, in form, of a fiatted globe, which is a finguiar kind of arc.hitedlure. It is payed with fine marble, and irt it a tomb, which the Turks fay is Constantine’s, and a stone, on which they believe, the virgin washeei our Lord’s linnen, to which they beay great reverence...

There are Several other moSques, called Imperial, the chief of which is named So-liinania, becauSe it was built by Sultan' Sohinan, whoSe cossin remains in it, adorned with carpets, and a turban Set with heron feathers and precious stones; this> place is a)So illuminated with many lamps,, kept constantly bsirning. Several Alco-raii’s are chained to it, that the peopte may read them, and pray for the defunft’s-Soul. All the moSques have hoSpitals and Schools, where a great number of Scholars are maintained and educated. Most of the ahtient statues,, ob^lisscs, and pidlures, Sec up by Conftantine and his Successors, are entirely ruined, yet the large Elippo-drome, where they exerciSed their horSes in racing, is still to be Seen. It is a large: Square, 550 paces long, and 150 broad. In the midst of it is an obelissc, almost entire, marked with hieroglyphics ; near which is a pillar, composted of large stones,, without cement, and towards the end of it, another made of three brafs ferpents

It was Said to be the TaliSman, or Spell, raiSed by Leo ISauricus, the emperor, against Serpents, So that none would come near, till Mahomet II. when he took Constantinople, beat off the under jaw of one of them with his zuagaye, and now they are Said to do no hurt.
The grand Bezistan^ or Exchange, is a noble building, being a great round hall,, built with free stone, and Surrounded with a thick wall, in which are shops full of the richest merchandize. It has Several gates, which are shut fast at nights; and-, becaufe no body lies in it, it is guarded by watchmen till it is opened again. Each body of merchants, or tradeSmen, have an apartment by themSelves, and no man may Sell the Same goods in another’s place. There is alSo another Bezistan, but not SO: large as the former,, or So well Supplied, with merchandize. There are leveral markets, one called the woman’s, in which '	is a pillar, 147 feet high; but I believe
this I mentioned formerly.

longing to the grand Seignior, the old and the new, which being much the more noble building, though not any thing near So magnificent as the palace of So great a prince ought to be, is called the Grand Seraglio. It is of a triangular form, two sides of which are encompassed by the Thracian BoSphorus, and the other divides it from the town. It is three miles in circumference, and incloSed with a strong wall, upon which are Several watch-towers,, alio many gates both on the Sea and land sides, but the principal is towards the city ; the rest; being never opened but on Some Special occasions. The chief gate abovementioned, is guarded by Several companies of porters, under the command; of the captains of the companies. A company of Janizaries watch without the palace, and are to give notice of any accident. In this feraglio arc many stately rooms, fuiting the fcafon of the year, the greatest part whereof are built upon plain ground, and fome upon the hills and fea side, among v:hich last; is the chamber where the grand Seignior gives audience to ambassadors, bashas, &c: Hiis room stands in a court, adorned with many I	beau-

Near it is a Small room, lined with silver plate, gilt with gold* To theSe lodgings of the Sultan, belong Some very fine gardens, containing all Sorts of flowers and fruits,. handSome walls, and elegant marble fountains ; there are alSo lodgings for the women, like a nunnery, wherein the Sultana queen, the other Sultanas, and all the grand Seignior’s women dwell, in which are bed-chambers, dancing rooms, bagnios, and all other buildings necessary for the Service of the women ; there are alSo.-convenient rooms for the principal and inferior officers, all vrell furnished, among, which are the Sultan’s private treafury and wardrobes, both strong buildings, v/ith iron doors, which are kept continually ■ shut, and the former is Sealed v/ith the So-vereiom’s Seal. In the Seraglio are alfb-rooms for prayer, baths. Schools, butteries, kitchens, distilling-rooms, places to Swim in, and to run horfes, for wrestling i	and shooting at butts, and, in a word, all

Beyond this is another court, far more beautiful, adorned with fountains,, cyprefs trees, &c. it is 300 paces Square, and the walks paved. In this court all must walk » on foot, except the grand Seignior ; here are alSo Several, kitchens, with their offices-and larders, for the Sultanas, and the officers of the court. On the left side is the Sultan’s little stable, containing about 35 horSes for his uSe, and over it rooms for their furniture, which are very rich, and* Set with many jewels. Next the stables are rooms for the officers of the Divan, or court of justice, and near thereto the chamber where the Divan firs, and a little behind that is the gate v:hlch leads to the women’s- lodgings. At the end of j	this court is the royal gate, v/liich leads
to the Sultan’s lodgings, where none are to enter but the gentlemen that attend him, &c. v/ithout the Sultan’s leave. The gate is kept by the chief chamberlain, and
a com-
iro MEMOIRS of
a company of white eunuchs. The court rs paved with fine marble, v/rought with MoSaic wmrk, adorned with curious fountains, and a lake, where the Sultan has a gilt boat for his reception. In the buildings, which are Sumptuous, are a chamber of audience, a row of Summer rooms, standing on a little hill, looking to the Sea, a large hall standing on pillars, and opening towards the east, and by it the grand Seignior’s bed-chamber, the w'alls of which are covered with the finest China, and the fioor with very costly carpets of silk and gold. The posts of the bcdSceads are Silver ; the canopy, bolsters, matrasses, and pillows, are alSo of cloth of gold. Behind the hail is a place to shoot in, where many bows and ari'ows are kept.
The Divan sits four days in the week, viz. Saturday, Sunday, Monday, aiid TueS-day, on which days the chief Vizier, who is the fupreme judge, and reprefents^ the grand Seignior, with ail the rest of the Viziers, are to be there by daybreak. Before this grand affembly the petitioners fpeak for tliemfelves, not be-ina: allowed councestors orattornies. When the chief Vizier harh heard their fuits, he eonshlts with the bashas, and then re-

Solves and determines them as he will himSelf; this he uSually does after dinnui-, and then he repairs on Sund;iys and TueS-days, to the chamber of audience, to give the Grand Seignior an account of what bufineSs he has diSpatched. The Sultan’ Sometimes will come privately to a little window, which is covered with a lattice, and looks into the Divan, to hear the cauSes ; and this obliges the prime Vizier, to a6t circumSpedtly and justly in managing affairs while he sits there, though, at other, times his hands are open to bribery, and he will carry buSineSs as he pleaSes ; but all things are cliSpatched without delay.
When an ambassador from a greatprince arrives, he is first, with great Iblemnity, condudled to the prime Vizier, with whom he dines, and is then conveyed to a room near the imperial gate, with his attendants, where he remains till the Sultan is ready to receive him.
In the riiean time the ambassadors present, is carried about the Second court, in the sight of all the people, and then is brought to the Sultan, and the Grand Vizier Sends the ambassador Several vests, appointed by the antient ciiStom, for him-Self and gentlemen to put on for that ce-

are of little or no value, yet the ambaffa-	:■
dor is obliged to make a preSent of more than the v/orth of them, and then he is conduced, by the master of the ceremonies to kiSs the Sultan’s hand, which is no more than his hanging fieeve; this done, She interpreter declares the ambaS-fador’s commission, to wshich the Grand Seignior makes no anSwer, diSdaining to.
Speak to a Christian, but turning to the prime Vizier, refers all proceedings to his discretion, and So the ambassador departs, -bov/ing his head to the Sultan, but not putting off his hat at all. The ambaSSi-dors of petty princes, or states, though they have vests given them., yet come not to the Divan, but go privately with their preSents. All ambassadors are maiji-tained by the Grand Seignior, except tstofe from the state of Venice, during their abode at the port, but it is hard to get his allowance* through the bafenefs of the ministers. But I mnast at prefent conclude,.

AS you Say the Subjedl of my last was curious, and that you were pleated with it, I shall proceed.
All perSons that live in the Seraglio, are the Grand Seignior’s Oaves, as, in fa<st, are all thoSe that are fwbjedl to his dominion ; for they all acknowledge, that whatever they enjoy proceeds from his good will, and that their estates and lives are absolutely at his diSpoSal. There are, i n the Sultan’s court, above 12000 women,, old and young ; his concubines, who are-kept for their beauty, are all young virgins, brought from Several countries, in-itrudled in good behaviour, dancing, music, Singing, and curious v/ork, &c. being Sent to the Grand Seignior as preSents, by the Tartar, basha’s, and other gentlemen, aird So their numbers are uncertain y theSe virgins, immediately upon their coming into the Seraglio, are made Turks,.
I	by their using this ceremony; ‘ There is.
no God, but God alone, and Maho-“ met is the messenger of God;” and then being examined by the mother of !	the mnids, they are placed in a room,
tvith.
114 M E M O I R S of
with their equrds in age and diSpositiom Alt the women .live like nuns, but have large apartments to dwell in ; their beds, are coarSe and hard, made of stocks, and by every tenth virgin lies an old woman, and there are lamps alvrays burning by them. Near their apartments they have baths and fountains, and above their bed-cliambers, places to Set and Sew it. Tliey dine in companies, and are waited upon by other women, wanting nothing that is necessary for them ; there are alSo Schools for Such as will learn to read, or Speak the Turkish language, work or play, and Some hours are allov:ed them for walking and recreation.
The Sultan never fees theSe virgins, un-leSs when they are first preSented to bim, or vrhen he desires to have one of them for his bed-fellow, and divert himSelf with music, or any other pastime. When the Grand Seignior deSires a fresh mate, he gives notice to the grand master -of the Sei'aglio, who chuSes Some of the fairest and most pleasing,, and having placed them in two rows, in a room, brings m the Sultan, who walking four or five times in the midst of them, views them, and as he goes out, throws his handkerchief into.

the virgin’s hand, that he makes choice of. This choice is accounted a great favour, and the governeSs uSes all the art she can to prepare her for it, by attiring, painting, and perfuming her, and at night, she is brought to sseep with the Sultan, in certain chambers, Set apart for that pur^ poSe in the women’s lodgings. By the bed they have great wax tapers burning all night, and Moorish, women Sitting by ‘	them. In. the morning, when the Sultan
I	rlSes, he changes all his apparel, and leaves
them to his bed-fellow, then departs to.> his own lodgings, from whence he immediately Sends her jewels, money, and. vests of greater, or leSs value, according to the Satisfadlion she gave him.
If any conceive by him, and bring hin\ forth his first begotten child, she is called Sultana Queen ; and, if it be a Son, she is, confirmed and established by great feasta and Solemnities, and thence forward has an apartment. Servants, and a large reve-. nue appointed her, and all perSons in the Seraglio must pay her the reSpedl of a queen. The other women that bear him, children are all called Sultanas, but not I	queens, yet five in Separate apartments;,
g,j:e well Served and attended, and have
m

no want either of money or apparel, according to their degree. But if the first;-begotten Son of the queen, who is heir to the empire, happens to die, and another of the; Sultana’s hath a Son to Succeed the deceaSed, the former is deprived of her revenue and royalty, but remains a Sultana, and the latter becomes Queen, and So the title deScends from one to another, by virtue of the Son’s right of Succession. TheSe Sultanas never go out of the palace, but in the Sultan’s company, and are never Seen by any but by Such as attend them, v/ha a.re black eunuchs, and are taken proper care of, that no danger fnay enfue.
The Grand Seignior’s daughters, fisters,, and aunts,, have lodgings alSo in the fc:-raglio, and live by themfelves in continual pieafure, till Such time as. the Sultan shall be plealed to give them in marriage, and then they come forth, carrying each a chest along with them,, v/hich the Grand Seignior allows them, commonly Sull of rich apparel, jewels, and money, to the amount of thirty thouSand pounds sterling, alSo women staves and eunuchs, anci he Sometinfies continues, their allowance of

% thoufand, or fifteen hundred aSpers ^ per day, which they enjoyed in the Scra»« glio. Nay, if the husband of the lady has not a houfe fit for her, the Sultan ve-jy often gives her one of his own.
As for the husband, he is to make her
I	a bill of dowry, of at least 100,000 Se*-
quins f in money, besides vests, jewels, iand other ornaments, which amount to a great Sum. When married they converfe with men no more than they did before, but only wsith women, visiting their old ace|uaintances in the Sei*aglio only, and not this without the Grand Seignior’s leave. The Sultanas thus married, are for the most part their hushand’s mistresses, inSuiting over, and commanding them as they pleaSe, wearing a dagger in token of their power over them, and Sometimes they will put them away, and take others, and a divorce of this kind commonly proves the death of the hushand.
The other females either grow old in the leraglio, and fo are made mistrefs over the young ones, or are feat into the old Seraglio, which they account their best

After dinner he Sends a New year’s gift to all of them, according to their quality ; but as the Grand Seignior gives. So he alSo receives preSents from the Bashas, and other great perSons, at the fame time, who strive to exceed each other in the value of their gifts, that they may gain favour.
Besides the feraglio here deScribed, there is another in Constantinople, mentioned before, called the Old Seraglio, So named becaufe it was the first, built by Mahomet the Second. It is a large place, about four or five miles in compaSs, and Seated in the best part of the city ; it is Surrounded by a high wall, has but one gate, and that is of iron, which is kept by a guard of white eunuchs. The inhabitants of it, are all women and eunuchs ; the women
ar«
Mr. Charles Guildford. i%^
are only Such as have been put out of the Grand Seignior’s Seraglio, viz. the Sultanas of the deceaSed monarch, Such as are fallen into diSgracc, and Such as are infirm and defedtive in Something that should fic them for the Sultan’s bed; they are governed by an old woman, who is to take care that they have all things necessary, according to the ufual custom of the houSe. The Sultanas have lodgings, and are pretty well Served, though far short of what they had in the Sultan’s Seraglio. If they -are rich when Sent thither, they take care to make it publick, and procure them a good hushand and jointure. The Sultan will Sometimes go thither to visit his grandmother, sisters, and other relations, or when he is melancholy.
In the Suburbs of Constantinople, called Galata, are Some good houSes, well built; many Greeks and Franks live there ; there is alio the finest fish market in the world, where there is great plenty of all Sorts of fish to be had very cheap.
Beyond Galata, lies Pern, a large borough, Separated only by burying places. (Galata being Separated from the city by the port.) In this town reside the ambassadors from Christian princes, for the G 2	Empc-*

LETTER XII.
WELL my friend if I thought I should not tire you with the account I give you of theSe people, I would venture a little farther, 1 think nothing more curious than an account of people in different nations, their buildr ings, &c. together with their customs, manners, learning, religion, government,
‘	&c. As it is not every one, I may Say
there are but few, who have an opportunity of knowing any thing of their fek ipw creatures that inhabit the other parts
of
Mr. Charles Guildford. 125
of the world, but by the relation of a few.
I will therefore proceed without farther apology, only I will before hand assure you, I will not be too prolix.
The Turks are in general well shaped, and have strong and robust constitutions. Their habit is of itSelf Sufficient to make them appear graceful, and to hide defedta if they have any. As for their dreSs ,i shall not be particular. They uSuallywear two daggers, their handles and Scabbards being ornamented with gold, and Som.e-times with preciosis stones.
4	Their heads are generally covered
with a crimSon velvet cap, without brims, about which they wreath a white or red turbant, which is a Sash of silk or linen many ells long; and by the fashion of this the quality of the men is known. The dreSs of the ladies of Constantinople, hath a peculiar air of grandeur and magnificence, and much exceeds the apparel of other women in Turky.
Their head-dreSs is compoSed of many handerchief’s of various colours, all worked with gold and Silver, Set with a G 3	great
[
126 MEMOIRS of
great variety of precious stones, and adorned with Several Sorts of flowers. They can put it on or off without undoing it: they uSually wear it Several days, and then alter it, into Some other fashion, but it is often So heavy that it is a burthen to the wearer. Their outward garment is a white gown, edged at the bot-^ tom with gold lace and fringe, which in winter is lined with fur, as the men line their garments. The ladies in the Seraglio Sometimes wear on their heads a fur cap, others a round plaiting like the jew-ish women, with a feather on each fick and plumes at their ears.
The Turks shave their their heads, but Suffer their beards and mustacho’s to grow, have a great esteem for a man v:ith a lovely beard, and think it a great affront to take a man by it.
They make great ufe of bathing, both, for keeping their bodies neat and clean, and for their health-lake ; and in every town they have many fair Bagnio’s, the Smallest village never being without one. The poorest perfon, man or woman goes to the bath once aweek. The women go in by themSelves attended by the women
only
Mr. Charles Guildford. 127
only, and it is a capital crime for a man to go into a bath where women are.
They have no Sumptuous feasts, but are content with a little. They uSe no knivCs but pull their meat to pieces with their fingers, it being dressed properly for that purpofe, and then every one takes his share. Water is in general their drink, tho’ they have good Snerbet, made in Egypt of Sugar,lemon-juice, muSk, amber greaSe, and roSewater. At their great treats they give coffee, sherbet, and perfurhe for their beards. They Spread quilts on the ground for their bedding and every one lies on his own.	,
They will play at chefs, draughts, tables, &c. but never play for money or any thing of value becauSe they think it Sinful; and yet they will Spenci a whole afternoon at theSe games. The Turks have here the advantage of the civilized Christians.
The Turkish language is a primitive and oriental tongue, and though not very copious, yet it is grave and pleaSant, rich and elegant enough. They are not much addided to Sciences, yet have doctors of the law v/ho explain it in all the SenSes that can be given it. They are G 4	too
1<2? M E M O I R s of
too much addided to fortune telling, and ridiculous whims, in Searching for future events, and never undertake any thing of confequence, without first putting Some of thde whims in pradice, and as that; anfwers they either proceed or defer their design.
They have few physicians, being very healthy becauSe of their frequent bathing and temperance.
As to their religion, they acknowledge one God, and Say mahomet is his prophet. There are in that as in most other religions, in the world many abSurdities, of which the Turks might be easily convinced, but their prophet has politically provided against innovation, by commanding, that whoever contradided it, should be putta death.
- A Christian is not allowed to touch th® Alcoran, arid as to the Turks, they, reading it, in their opinion, merit para-dife. It is written in pure arabic, and the Turks are fo bigotted, as to believe it cannot be turned into any other language; and for this very reaSon, they call the Persians heretics bccaufe they have tranfiated it into their tongue.
This
Mr. CHARtES (jstllDFMt). 12^
This book contains all their laws both canon and civil; but is full of rabbinical fables. According to this book, the Turks worship. God, the eternal and almighty creator of heaven and earth; deny the Trinity, nor will they allow any images in his worship, either painted or engraved. They are fond of predestination, and extend it even to the most indifferent adti-' ons. It is this mak-es them fight without fear, believing if they are killed, they should have died at home Some other way; nor do they even uSe any method to preserve themSelves from the plague or other infedlious diSeaSes.
They believe that JeSus-Christ was conceived by the Spirit of God, in the Virgin’s womb; but deny him to be the Son of God, who is one, and hath no partner; 'They believe a future state, but they have a strange idea of it. One of their happineffes which they are to enjoy in pa-radiSe is, the constant Society of lovely virgin’s, with black eyes, and Ikins as white as ermine, alw^ays young.
They pray for their dead, and call on their Saints to recommend them to God. They allow of guardian angels. They circumciSe their children, as the jews do G 6	only
«30 M E M O I R S of
only not at eight days old, but at eleven or twelve.
When a Christian turns Turk, he is alfo circumciSed, but a Jew is not. The Turks receive the ten commandments of MoSes’s law, and to them Mahomet has added five, viz. To believe one only God, and to worship him as Such : to fast during the Ramadan: (similar to our lent.) To pray at the hours appointed : To give the poor yearly a fortieth part of their Substance: to go in pilgrimage to Meccaonce in their lives.
The Turks have their Clergy, as all ‘other religions have, to Solve their doubts and celebrate divine Service. They are most ot them knowing men. The chief ccclefiastic is the Mufti, whom they reverence as much as the Romanists do the Pope. He is choSen by the Grand Seig^ nior, and is always a learned man in their w^ay, that is much verSed in the Alcoran, for he reSolves all matters of conScience, and gives his deScisions in little writs, to which even the Sultan hirnSelf must stand, though by adding theSe words (but God is the best judge,) he shews that he does not pretend to infallibility. He is married.
\
Mr. Charles Guildford. 131
I	'	'	.	.
He is held in Such high veneration, that, the Grand Seignior himSelf riSes to meet and Salute him when he comes to court. It is unlawful by their law to put their Mufti to death; yet Some Emperors. have done it. There is but one Mufti, he resides at Constantinople where he finds buSineSs enough; the justices perform his offices in other places. The Sultan conSults the Mufti in state affairs, as when he designs to put any prime mir I	nister to death, diSgrace a'Basha, or un,-
I	dertake any other buSineSs of importance,
I	but the Mufti has no power over the
I	Imans, or priests, becauSe the Turks have
no hierarchy.
The marriage of the Turks is of thre« Sorts, having as many Sorts of wives. First lawful wives, which they take after the following manner; the man that desires to be married, agrees with the'parents ot| guardians of the maid about what they wil give for< her portion, which the justice, before whom the agreement is made,
!	writes down. This done^ he gets a priest .
to blefs his marriage, and then the bridegroom on the marriage day, leads the bride to his houSe^ her baggage being 1	carried by hoistes or camels before them,
G 6	and
MEMOIRS of
and there they feast and are merry, this’ men and women by themSelves, where they commonly have music &c. for the diverfion of the company. TheSe wives ^ the Turks may divorce when theypleaSe, by Saying, (I part with you for three times.) But if a man puts away his wife wrongfully, he must return her dowry; though if he does it upon Just grounds^ or she forSakes him, he gives her nothing. When a woman is thus divorced, she must not marry another man still four months after, that she may be certain whether fne was with Child, for if she be, the hushand that divorced her must keep it, and if she be not. Such matches are often made up in that time. A man that hath divorced his wife cannot marry her again still she has been first married to another man, and then he may take her back. Of theSe wives the Turks can have but one.
They may alSo have wives which they take with leSs ceremony than the former, for they only go to the justice and tell him that they take Such a one to be their wife, promising to give her So much if they divorce her. This the Cadi, or juf-tice writes down, and gives the man a
copy.
Mr. Charles Guildford. 135
copy, then he may keep or divorce her as he pleaSes, performing his promiSe and maintaining the children ho has by her. The Turks may have as many of theSe wives as they can keep, but to Save charges, Some of them will have no more thai> one or two.
The third kind of wives are women staves, and of thefe every man may have as many as he will, and the children begotten of them are held as legitimate, as thoSe of the former wives, and have as much title to the inheritance of what the father leaves behind him, if by his will he makes them free, other wife they remain staves to the eldest ch Id, by the lawful wife ; but if a Turk takes a stave to his Ted, he must not fell her again if she has children, for she becomes a member of his family, if she proves barren she may be lold again as often as her masters will.
The Turks buy all Sorts of staves, of every religion and nation; but Christians and Jews may not buy a Turk. Every i	Wednesday at Constantinople there is a
j	market for staves, where every one may
buy for their Several uSes their lust not ex-I	cepted. TheSe staves are bought and Sold
.	like HorSes, viewed, reviewed, and felt
all over their bodies, and their mouths

looked into, being alSo examined concerning their country and age. A beautiful virgin, at theSe markets is held at a high rate, but the Seller is anSwerable for her virginity, for if she prove otherwise, he must return the money she was Sold for, and Submit to a fine for his fraud.
The Slaves of the Turks are not So miserable as is SuppoSed. If they have merit, they have great favour shewn them, and may live happily; they are very frequently, alSo, in favour with their miS-tresses, who, through a tender compassion, natural to their Sex, make them presents, &c.
Tlie Turkish women are commonly beautiful, strait, and wtII shaped, but they never go abroad without a veil to cover their faces; they are cleanly and neat, for going into the bath twice a w'eek is of great Service to them in that reSpesst. , When they go abroad, they generally muffle up their hands. So that there is nothing but their eyes uncovered; nay, their shift fieeves cover their hands, becauSe it is a thing of ill repute to shew any part of their bodies, yet in the corner of a street they will venture to uncover their face to a friend, or a young man
they
Mr. Charles Guildford, 135
they like, though, if discovered, they are bastinadoed. They are very haughty, and extremely lazy; they do nothing, but sit embroidering a handkerchief, and yet they will have staves to attend them, let their hushands be ever So poor ; this idleneSs makes them vicious, and Seek only ways of obtaining their pleaSures, of which their hushands are So jealous, that they will not Suffer them to shew themSelves to a man, and, if they do, they are certain of receiving the bastinadoe on a part I do not chuSe to name; for this reaSon the women are Seldom Suffered to go to the moSques or markets, or appear in their hushands shops.
As to the buryings of the Turks, there is as much lamentation, howling, and crying, as among the wild Irish, and as diS-Sffreeable as the howls of the Savages. They bury without the city, according to the custom of the ancients, becauSe they will not be affedted by the noxious vapours arising from their corpfes.
The Turks are, in general, honest people, and love honesty, whether in Turk, Jew, or Christian. Some are bad enough, and there is not any large Society on earth, but will, on examination, be found to be ■	plen-
136 M E M O I R S of
plentifully provided with bad members ; they are very zealous for religion, and endeavour to make as many proSelites as they can. If a Christian is guilty of ever So great a ctime, he is, in general pardoned, if he will turn Mahometan. They are very loyal. Seldom quarrel among themSelves; they are strangers to duelling, this is the natural conSequence of their great prophet’s wiSe policy, who forbid them wine, and gaming for money ; they are, however, very proud and haughty, and often inSolent towards ChriStians, but as to this I fancy the Christians can retaliate it on any who visit our hoSpitable shore.
The empire of the Turks is hereditary, and passes regularly in a lineal deScent to the right heir, who is always of the Ottoman family, for which the Turks have So great a veneration, that they will not Submit to any other government.
The Sultan’s power is abfolute, and his will the only law by which he rules. He is not curbed by any written law or cuS-tom. So' that the oppressed have not a right to complain. He may take away any man’s estate, prefer the meanest persons to the highest dignities, and Send for
the
Mr. Charles Guildford. 137
the head of any perSon he pleiSes, without trial of justice, and nuone has a right to enquire the cauSe. This unlimited, power of the Sultan, is founded on the Mahometan religion, which enjoins a blind obedience to all his commands under pain of damnation.
Some of the Sultan’s have often gone abroad incog: to See if their orclers are punctually obServed; and this is of Service to the Christians, who by that means are more free from affronts, than they otherwise would be. The Sultan Amurth wens out often thus; and one day ordered a butchers head to be cut off, for Selling meat above the fixed price; and two more men to be beheaded for Smoaking Tobacco, which had occafioned Several fires in Constantinople, their houSes being built of wood and very liable to take fire.
The chief minister of state is the Grand Vizier, who is called king of the-Turks. He receives ambassadors, hears their proposals, and gives them an anSwer; the two audiences which the Grand Seignor allows them being only for ceremony, at their coming and on their departure. He pays the army, condemns criminals, and decides law-Suits; but no trial here, un-

So that no man is wearied and ruined by lawyers and delays, as in other places: nor is there, according to what my friend Ofman Says, any fear but that justice will stridtly be administered^ becaufe, at the end of the hall where they fet, is a window covered with black crape where the Grand Seignior hears and Secs -when he pleaSes, what passes, without be* ing discovered; and the judges, fearing he may be there, dare not paSs an unjust Sentence; for if he finds it out, it would immediately cost them their lives.
They take great cate of provisions. &c. that every thing may be cheap, and stridl-ly examine all weights and mcafures, &c. The Same precautions are taken that no quarrel happens in the streets, for there’s a law that if a dead body be found before any one’s door he must pay for blood five hundred piastres. So that every one is obliged to take care.

LETTER XIII.
IN your anSwer to my last, you alk me what learning the Turks have amongst ^ them, and whether they cultivate the Sciences ^
In anSwcr to this I must inSorm you, that in the first place there are Some of them are men of SenSe and possessed of Some learning, but there are only a few, and the greater part if not all of thoSe that I	have learning are in a great meaSure be-;
holden to the Christians for it.
But
MO M E M O I R S of
But my friend, when you consider that the Grand S:ignior is deSpotic, you will not wonder at his Subjects being ignorant. They are educated in ignorance and fear. The implicit obedience they pay to their Sovereign’s commands implies the greatest ignorance not cnly in them, but even in he who commands them. He has never any occasion to deliberate, to doubt, or to reaSon : he has only to will.
In deSpotic estates, each houSe is a Se^ perate empire. Their education, which principally consists in learning how to live with others, is confined within narrow limits; education hath only to instill into the hearts of her pupils, a principle of fear, and to give to the mind t^e knowledge of Some few principles of religion. Learning would there be dangerous, and emulation fatal, and as for the Social virtues, Aristotle, could not believe there were any proper for staves ; it is this which lays a great restraint on education in a deSpotic government.
They have little therefore or nothing to do with education, you m.ust remove her, and begin by making a bad Subject to make a good stave.
What
Mr. Charles Guildford. 141
What end would it anSwer, by education to form a good citizen, in order af-i	terwards to bear a part in the public miS-
fortunes? If he loved his country, he would endeavour to releaSe it from the miseries attending Such a government; if he could not Succeed, his own ruin must be the conlequence of his miScarriage ; and if he did Succeed, he would run a i	great riSque of ruining himSelf, his prince,
and the empire likewiSe.
As to fear my friend tis absolutely necessary in a deSpotic state. Political ho-,	nour is not here found. That glories in
the Scorn of life, and the only force of de-j	fpotic princes, consists in the power of tak-
ing life away. Honour therefore in Such a state would be dangerous, and what is called political virtue will on refiedtion appear unnecessary.
People who are capable ©f having a ' great esteem, for themSelves, are the most likely to caufe a revolution. Fearisthere-I	fore necessary to abate their courage, and
I	extinguish in them every Spark of ambi-
tion.
In deSpotic states the nature of their government demands the most perfedl: obedience
\
I
I
i
t42 M E M O I R S of
dience, and the very moment the will of the prince is known, it must be obeyed.
In PerSia when the king hath condemned a peision no one dares Speak in favour of the culprit or demand any grace for him. If the prince is even drunk or out of his SenSes, the Sentence must be put in execution notwithstanding; he would otherwise be contradidled, and stis there a maxim, that the law (for Such is the prince’s will) cannot be contradidled.
Yet religion may be oppoSed, to the princes will. The Subjedt will abandon a father or siay himSelf if the prince commands it: but they will not drink Wine, if he desired it; or even if he ordered it.
The laws of religion are precepts Superior to his, becauSe they are given to the prince as well as to the lubject. But when the question relates to the laws of nature, its then different, the prince is Suppofed no longer to be a man.
But I will here end my long observation on the Turks, by giving a few lines of AddiSon’s on that invaluable bleshng liberty.
Oh
Mr. Charles Guildford. 143
Oh liberty I Thou GoddeSs Heavshly “ bright,
ProfuSe of bliSs and pregnant with de-“ light;
Eternal pleaSures in thy preSence reign, “ And Smiling plenty leads thy wanton “ train.
“ EaS’d of her load Subiedion grows more “ light;
And poverty looks cliearful in thy sight. “ Thou mak’st the gloomy face of nature “gay,
“ Giv’st beauty to the Sun and pleaSure to “ the day.
It would never, my friend, enter into 'the mind of a Turk, to write Such lines were the Turks the best poets in the world. But now I bid them ad eu, and return again to our own history, though H	our situation was changed for the better
;	yet it began to grow irkSome.

I -	A fitw days puffed in this manner, when
I judged what my intriguing friends had Said, was only a jest. To confeSs the truth, I was not much obliged to them for their company, for they readily left me alone, whenever they could enjoy "	the company of their favourites. And
since their acquaintance v/ith thefe girls,
I had often passed a good part of my time alone, and under siich circumstances, felf, was not always the most agreeable compar ny. I Several times, for their fakes, as well as my own, almost wished our owner, who v/as himSelf pretty much employed, and who looked on us as men of honour, and therefore did not keep a strict guard over us, knew of my companions amours. He had not much employment for us fo that we had a great part of our time to OLirSelves, and farther, we had agreed to make him amends for our time, as alSo for the liberty he gave us, of walking about Some very fine s:ardens he had.
'	Such was my Situation when one day ,
my companions, as they had Several times H 4	before

We amuSed ourSelves there, for Some time, when I walked up towards a Summer houSe at the farther end of the walk.,
I arrived at the Summer houSe, and was passing it, to turn down another walk when I W'Rs greatly Surprized by one of the most beautiful young ladies 1 ever beheld, sitting in an elegant genteel dishabille, in a pensive manner, but in Such a situation, that I had a full view of her face, which was then wholly uncovered.
She Seemed oppressed v/ith Something that lay heavy on her mind, and I could not avoid engaging mySelf in what con^ cerned lo amiable a creature.
I approached her with that reverence and reSpedt I thought justly her due, and v;ith all the deference imaginable, enquired the cauSe of that melancholy that, appeared on her face.
She with all the Sweetnefs imaginable,, anSwered, she was forry I had Surprized her in Such an attitude, and much more that I had discovered any the least appearance of a melancholy, the cauSe of v/hicsi

she had great reaSon to fear, she should never be able to remove.
*	Her Sweet and amiable manner of Speak-
ing, together with her perSon, inSensibly engaged me to enter into a particular conversation with her, and endeavour to find out, the cauSe that gave pain to this charming fair one. I gently pressed her to esteem me as a friend, that if it was in my power, I would relieve her of the anguish under which she Seemed to labour, or if not, yet that I was ready to do her any Service I could.
She Seemed to fetch a deep sigh, at what I Said, and So far from Saying it was not m my povver to Serve her. Said nothing, but Seemed to view me with concern, and as I thought in a languishing manner, that affedied me prodigiouliy.-— Pardon me my friend, and may Charlotte do the fame; I now forgot every thinm but how to ferve this beautiful
Oi'
young creature, and ingratiate myfelf , with her.
This being my intent; you may believe I ufed every argument I could think of, to dilcover the caufe of this young beauty’s uneasinefs. She Seemed greatly pleaU ed with my behaviour, her counte-H 5	^ nance ,

nance gradually cleared up, and nothing but the most charming Smiles appeared.. Her eyes brightened and shot forth Such kind. Such piercing glances that melted all my frozen blood ; my boasted prudence and philoSophy vanished, I was now become the stave of a newborn passion, and had but one single grain of prudence left, which was to extort the Secret that I wanted to know, from the fair one, for fear Some engagement, destruDive to my hopes should be the cauSe of her uneasi-neSs.
She had given me reaSon to believe that my behaviour hitherto had not dif-pleaSed her.—I therefore persisted in my resolution, and again preffed her to make a free diScovery to me.—She could not any longer resist my importunities: she confessed it was love.—d started at it, and; was prodigiousty confuSed—-She obServed it—And I thought wsith pleaSure.—This Surprized yet pleaSed me. I was ready enough to construe the whole to my own advantage.
I wished mySelf the objed of her love, and ventured freely to tell her, what were my wishes. She did notSeem diffansfied, but after recovering herSelf from the moSt

charming confusion confessed, if Such were my vrishes she was happy.
If she SuppoSed herSeif happy, I thought my Self bleffed beyond expression, or even the conception of any but my Self. I was lost in an extaSy of joy—I could not at first believe what I Saw and heard a relity,
I imagined the whole a dream, and feared to av/ake.
I have often Tefiecsted since on this Scene, and am always, whenever I think of it, greatly Surprized at the prodigious aScendancy. that beauty So inStantancoussy gained over my Soul.
I need not alter this my friend, tell you tliat I now endeavoured to improve the the hcppy moment. I pleaded my pafsi-on with all the rlieto-ric I was mailer of, and in fact love had given a Surprizing vo~ ^ lubility to my tongue.

I fiept a little, aroSe, appeared as chear-ful as ever among my companions. The. hour, the destined hour approached that was to determine whether I could ad like a man, and gain the aScendancy over my own passions or not. It came, I went to the Summer houSe according to my appointment. The fair one was there before me.
She looked at me with a fixed attention for a m-oment, and then with Such a kind '	concern ashed me if any thing had hap-
pened to give me uneaSineSs, that greatly ^ ’	disconcerted me. There appeared So much
tenderneSs, and So much charming mo-deStv in the inquiry she made, that it very much affeded me. What was become of my resolutionI could not tell her the true cauSe. Her concern unmanned me. There appeared So much innocence, mo-*	desty, and Sincerity in her, that I could
not conceive her capable of deceit, and therefore could not give credit to my own Suspicions, that she had only aded by design, or was any ways concerned in the Scheme I had luppoSed laid on purpoSe for me. The excuSe my friends had made the preceding evening, now appeared plausible and to confeSs the truth I was fa-

tisSied still to W'ear the fair ones chains. She Saw the power she had over me, and behaved in Such a manner, as confirmed me in the opinion I had formed of her character, and the love she professed for me. You may impute this to vanity my Sriend, and perhaps that might lend, a helping hand.
My natural reServe now vanished, and I again acled the part of a fond lover.---She took the advantage of the humour I vras in, and again ashed me the cauSe of my uneaSineSs that appeared on my countenance when I first approached her, adding, that had I been there first and waited any time for her, she should then have readily paid IierSelf a compliment, by Supposing that the cauSe. But as on the contrary she v/as punCcuar to her appointment, she thought that if I really loved her, the finding her there would have had a very different effedt on me, and Sue could only impute it, to a want of that love I profeffcd.
This was a reproof, I fo little deferved that i could not bear the thougiit of her entertaining Such an opinion of me, and therefore to e,rafe that lliSpicion from her mind, freely confeffed a part of the caufe,

viz. my SuSpicion of a Scheme ; in the most ingenuous manner. Though she appeared diSpleaSed with the distrust I had shewn of her fidelity, yet the ingenuous confession I had made, gave her Such a convincing proof of my regard for her that she readily forgave it, and acknowledged herSclf greatly obliged to me for the confidence I had placed in her, and to i	remove every Scruple of mine behaved
with equal ingenuity, by affuistng me, that she had often Seen me, since my arrival at Bagdat, and that her affedlions were involuntary engaged and had given her very great pain, as she had Several times met me and given me an opportunity of Seeing her, but that I did not Seem even to notice her, and that that only i	was the cauSe of the melancholy, I had
j	the preceding evening obServed.
j	Such a confession my friend, from So

having its natural effeft on a mind like mine, and I in return acknowledged my-!	Self as much obliged to her for this con-

But notwithstanding the love Site had confessed, she in other refpeds Seemed as cold as Snow on the mountains of CaucaSus, for I remember luch was the simile I uSed, when I told her my mind on that occasion.

I WAS So much absorbed in refieddons, on the happinefs- I expedled to find,, in the poffeSSion of this beauty, that I thought of little elSe, and was almost thrown off my guard before OSman and Omar, who however took So little notice of my looks, that I concluded, that So far from having laid any Scheme to draw me into this, they even did not know of it. We passed our time as uSual, and my friends generally'disappeared, the one after

I again attended my fair mistreSs, again pleaded my paSSion but still found the fort would not Surrender notwithstanding I laid cloSe siege. This opposition Served to inssame me the more, and though only three days were elapSed since our acquaintance, I had made as much progreSs in love, as if it had been three years.
Notwithstanding the obstinate opposition the fair one made, her behaviour Seemed to promiSe SucceSs, for fine every day nay every moment I was with her I Seemed to grow kinder, and I did not in the least doubt but I should in time Succeed.
She was a Georgian, and I have since learnt that the Georgian women are com-pleat mistresses in the art of love. As to my fair ones opposition, you’H ash the reaSon, and wonder, if she had any notions, of what the English ladies call modesty and chastity. And if she had, why, I should endeavour to Seduce her! Its a question that may naturally be ashed. But in my justification at least I must give you an ingenuous anSwer.
The
I
Mr. Charles Guildford. 165
The Georgians, as to modesty, poffeSs the lame share as uncultivated human beings, still they loSe any remains of it they have, when they grow sip, by the general example they continually See before their eyes, and as to chastity, the people live almost as free as nature’s commoners. Their education therefore, if they have any, is quite the reverSe of an English lady’s.
By this you will Say, I Seem to insinuate that my fair-one was not possessed of thoSe amiable virtues, which are the principal ornaments of the fair Sex, and that renders them worthy of being beloved. And on this Supposition, you may reaSonably alk what charms I could find in her, So strongly to attach me to her, particularly when my heart was pre-engaged.
Yet I think you know mankind too well to require an anSwer to Such interrogatories. But permit me however to an-;	Swer in a few lines from Pope in his essay
where treating of Self-love, paSSion and reaSon he Says.
“ Thicker than arguments, temptati-,	“ ons throng.
At best more watchful this, but that “ more strong.

And I am certain I’m a living instance ' to prove the truth of his words, but Sec what he Says in another place.
“ As man, perhaps, the moment of his “ breath,

I	Are not the whole of thefe lines, parti-
I	cularly the last four inimitable ? Such was
'	my cafe at thatjundlure.
But now to return to my fair one. As to modesty, I believe she had as much as most of her country women, whilst young, viz. Very little, for they have Scarce v/ords in their language to expreSs the
II	ideas of modesty and chastity. And as to chastity, it was every moment lyable to
Ibe invaded by her old master, if he had j	been
jsiS M E M O I R S of
been So inclined, for she had been tAeti prisoner by Some Turks in an excursion, and had been Sold to our owner, who had made a preSent of her to his favourite, who uSed her very well, and gave her every liberty she could wish, and all the indulgence she could grant. But Setting aside that, I believe her temper was Such, as not to let any young fellow who was agreeable to her, die at her feet through cruelty.
And is it to be wondered at? She had never been taught the dodirine of fubdio ing the paSSions, or acting contrary to her inclinations. In what manner therefore was she to adt, why? as her natural inclinations diredled, she had no other rules to : '	regulate her condudt by.
:	If Such were my fair ones principles,
;	why did I meet with Such an obstinate rest	Sistance. The best reaSon that can be gi-
I	ven my friend, not through a conSciouS-
neSs of adling wrong, did she at first avoid furrendering her beauty to my i	arms. Such an idea was the most foreign
j	of any from her mind. No my friend,
I	art was the cauSe, too ready a compliance
!	might Soon have produced Satiety. She
purSued the only means she could to render
I

der me constant. She knew our Sex : to do her justice, I must confeSs I believe it was not to her own experience but to ob- ’ Servations she had made in her own country, in Persia where she had been, and in other places, and to relations she had hearth
But to return to my Self, I relate to you things as they happened, therefore always give you my Sentiments as they v/ere at the time of acsting. Love was at present my predominant paSsion. It, like Aaron’s rod. Swallowed up all the rest.— As for reaSon she was not at this time, even '	a sharp accuSer, but rather tprned plead-
er to perSuade.
I now thought of Omar’s arguments, and that Some of them were very strong. 1 need not, after what I have Said, inform you, that I proSecuted this affair with the greatest vigour, without once refiedting on my conducts or what the future con-. Sequences might be. If refiedtion at any time wanted to Suggest thoughts not a-greeable to my paSSion, I immediately ba-nilbed Such rude intruders.

My fair mistreSs w'as as well pleaSed with me as I was with her. We Spent many hours together, with So much tranSport, and Such an exceS^ of bliSs that none but thoSe who have felt the like, can form an idea of our happinefs.
But my dear friend, what is more im-certain or sseetiag than human happineSs. Every thing finite, and that depends on iLs poor mortals, is liable to change. Such r an exceSs of bliSs as I have just before mentioned, was too great to be of long continuance. I will not fay, my friend, that possession cloyed, or that the ardour x)f my paSsion abated, but as I believe, (unleSs I am different from other men) the real caufe, reafon, after a full gratification of inordinate deSire, began to af-fume her Seat, and now became a sharp accuSer and not wholly a helpleSs friend. When after the highest enjoyment, the Spirits grow languid, a few leiSure hours hanging rather heavy on my hands, when my foul was not wholly bent on the Ob'* ject of an ungovernable pafsion, I had time for refiedlion. I did refiedt, and thoSe refiedlions convinced me, that I had adted wrong, been the dupe to my
passions,
Mr. Charles Guildford. 171
passions, which it is the buSineSs of every man poffeffed of common SenSe to Subdue.
I	But instead of conquering my passion, my
whole study, to my shame I must confeSs it, had lately been employed in the gratification of them.
Happily for me, the common frailty of the fair-Sex, at least of Some of them, now came in a lucky moment to my assistance. I was just beginning to consider in what manner I should afb So as to extricate mySelf, from an affair that now began to give me great uneaSineSs. The i	remembrance of Charlotte was a continu-
al reproach to my late procedure. I could not avoid thinking, I had a6ted by her, as I told Omar he had by Kilana, paid her a very bad compliment.
But no more refiedlions. My fair Georgian was of an inconstant disposition. I had before obServed the Georgians are -adepts in the art of love. In fadl I discovered her disposition was greatly inclined to variety, and just at this time, a young -	gentleman, who happened then to be un-
: '	happily in our owners power, becam.eher
, :	favourite, and as site began to attradt his

I 2	Seemed

Seemed only to Spend her time with me, when she had nothing elSe to employ her.
I was not dissatisfied on this occasion but determined to make a proper uSe of it. I . exerted mySelf with particular care, to discover this intrigue as it would entirely tree me from an affair, that my cooler reaSon would not permit me to proSecute, i must in justice to myfelf Say, it was not owing to any diSgust I had at first taken to my fair mistrefs: but folely owing to the ressections I had made, for before I tiifcovered her affection for my rival, I loved her as well as ever, but the difco-very of her inconstancy, you may reasonably SuppoSe, gave a very great turn to my affections, and Served to assist my rea-fon, in freeing mySelf from the afcendan.T ■ -cy she had gained over me.
As it was now of conSequence to me, to produce a convincing proof of the Georgian’s inconstrncy, I was very obfer-vant of what passed and Soon discovered her, indulging her favourite passion, in i • the arms of my happy rival, on whom I had reaSon to believe, she had pradiSed the ■	• fame arts, she had on me.

It is not to be luppoSed that a love So tender as mine, could be negleAed, without raising fuSpi.-cions, and I'uch was the natural effecst of your apparent coolneSs; I was above complaining; I therefore determined to know the cauSe.—I am Satisfied what the cauSc was, and cannot bear a divided love. As you have been inconstant to me, I have reSented it, in my opinion, in a proper manner. I have returned your unkind i	treatment, by a retaliation.
Nay frown not Mr. Guildford, Said she, on my looking very sternly on her, at this strange diScouisie. If my preSence I	is offensive, I am ready to depart. But
I	for the honour of my Sex, and particu>
larly of my country-women, I mustjuS-tify my Self, and affurc yon, I shall for ever glory in the revenge I have taken, particularly at your being an eye witneSs of it.
I could not bear her inSolence and excessive affurence any longer.—I freely told I 4	her

her my mind, not in vulgar terms of reproach, that would have been giving her an apportunity of triumphing, at gaining the only point, she Seemed then to aim at, but in genteel, yet contemptuous terms'. This had the desired effedt, it prevented her design, and in Some Sort humbled her. But she was blessed with assurance, and Soon recovered the little confusion I had thrown her into.
Finding her former plan would not Succeed she changed her method of proceeding, and acknowledged that by my itiethod of anSwering her, she feared I was inhoceht of what she had laid to my '	charge, and that she had been grossly im-
poSed on. That she had Sincerely loved she ; that she had placed the rnoSt unrer Served confidence in me, that she had de-'	pended on a continuance of my love, and
that I never would transfer that love to any other object, at least in that part of the world : that she had been informed I had lately adled by her, in the Same man* her as she had by me ; and that what Sly i	had done was only through a principle^f

It is really impossible for me to inform you, of all the arts she made uSe of. She became the most kind, tender, languishing creature that ever existed, but thanks , to my stars, the more art she uSed, the more I defpiSed her.
To affed a reconciliation, I told her I insisted on a particular concession. Such a one as in fad I durst not have ashed from an English lady; but I knew'my Georgian had a pretty good affurence to Support her in a trial, to her not very Severe. The concession I expeded was, that as my two friends OSman and Omar, notwithstanding all our Secrecy, knew of our connedions, she should before thena make a free acknowledgement of the steps she Iiad taken, with the new reSolution She had made, and promiSe if ever she repeated her intrigues with'her new admirer, or any other, whilst we were on good terms (as I would on that occasion for ever forSake her) she should never attempt a-again to justify herfeif, never attempt to reproach me with leaving her, never offer to fpeak to me again, and finally never entertain any the least refentment against me, but as freely forgive me, for my negled of her, as I should forgive I 6	her '

To theSe terms she confented, and then, I Scarce know how to mention it. Seemed inclined to Seal our reconciliation tho’ but just releaSedfrom another man’s arms with a renewal of our former Scenes of voluptuous pleaSure.
But as I had at preSent, through her I	own art, which I intended as her punish-

i	objedled against it, by insinuating, that it
I	was not customary with Christians, sh foon
to take a woman to their arms, that had i	been defiled by another. But gave her
room to believe, I would the next even-I	ing meet her, in the fame place provided
■	she complied, that day with the terms I
i	had proposed.
j	On this, she leemed to hint that I still

After I had taken leave of her, I informed OSman and Omar of my reaSon for calling them to witneSs my mistreSs’s resolution, and tire promiSe she fiad made.

I	My friends were as vigilent as my miS-

me free from the connedlions with her, and instantly called me, (I being at that time very near him) to be an eye witneSs of the guilty Scene.	”

As to mySelf, I will assure you, this affair gave me very great pain, for a considerable time after; not that I had lost, but that I had ever gained this Georgiari ^ for a mistreSs.
In short I cannot think of it now without regret.——Yet not to have fell, I must have been more than mortal, therefore, that I might not paSs for a God, I condescended to fink a step beneath my natural dignity, and prove mySelf Id's than man. But no more refiedtions; they may be diSagreeable. I have this Satisfaction to fay, I learnt more of the arts uSed by the fair Sex, (the worst part of them at least,) than if I had travelled over three fourths of the terrestial globe.

Just about this time, Saphis our owner’s; Son, whom we had never yet Seen, arrived from ISphahan. He was by profession a merchant, had travelled much, was well i	acquainted with the world, and although
he had not studied books much (though in Speculative knowledge he was not deficient,) yet he had studied men, and i	made many curious observations on the
(	fnannerSj laws and government, &c. of
the people he had been amongst in his travels. If ever he met with foreigners he was always curious to learn every particular he could from them concerning, their country, &c. that there were few ,	parts of the known world, but what he
was Somew'ay or other pretty well acquainted with. He was humane and generous, and no bigot to religion. Religi-I	on

gion was a SubjeD, he had been in-■quiSitivc concerning and finding there were almost as many religions in the world, as there were different nations on the face of the earth, he had compoSed a private religion for himSelf, though in external practice, he Seemed to adhere to the religion of his ancestors.
He had introduced himSeif to our acquaintance, as Soon as he came to Bag-dat, and we Soon became intimate. One ; c of the first topics that he entered on was^ j	religion. He discovered OSman was be-
i	come a Christian, he knew I was one, and
Jie found by his converfations with Omar,
.that though young, he was little more biaffed in favour of any particular religion, than himSelf.
When I was intimate with him and found he would not be offended at my freedom, I aSleed him what was his religion, for I found he was not prejudiced in favour of any particular fedt. He an-j	fwered his real religion was confined to a
few plain eafy principles and rules, the chief of which wTre, that there was but one Supreme Being infinite in wiSdom, power, and goodneSs, who created the univerSc, and every being that existed

therein. And as he had created, lo he I	constantly preServed them, by the Same
infinite wiSdom pov/er and goodneSs, that to him we were indebted for our being, and every blessing we enjoyed: and therefore,, that the most perfect obedience to his laws and the most perfe(51: gratitude for his favours was what we owed him.. That one of the principal laws we ought to obServe, was contained in the Christi-j	an religion, viz, “ to do to every one, as
!	“ vre wish they should do to us, in the
‘‘‘ like circumltances.” That in doing this we should “ do as much good and as “ little harm to our fellow creatures, as '	“ we possibly could.” And that “ uni-
“ verSal benevolence was the principal “ charaSteristic of a man-.
That as to Christ, Mahomet, Zoroaff ter, Confucius, &c. whom different nati-I	ons esteemed as the Saviours of mankind,
and as fomething more then men, thofe were opinions he could not hold. That there was fo great a difference between them, that it was hard to determine, to which to give the preference. That each was great in his ov/n manner of teaching. 'Lilac their religions might, though lo different, be properly adapted for the
peopk:
i88 MEMOIR S of
people professing them, their country, their climate, and their manner of living-
That I need not Speak in defence of Christ, or my friends in defence of Mahomet, that he would readily aliov/ them the honours due, particularly to Christ, viz. I'hat each had laid the foundations for a religion, now professed by millionsi, that Some of them must be wrong, why not all ? they were great teachers. That was all the honour he could allow them. That the Christian religion, which he informed me he was well acquainted with, i	contained many excellent moral rules, for
the condiKst of life, but that it was not perfedl; any more than the rest. That he was not fond of disputes, particularly re-i	ligioLis ones.
He would leave every man freely to i	enjoy his ' own opinion. I had^ mine, he
i	had his. But he believed I did not dif-

I	that his religion was plain and eaSy, and

jedled.against religious diSputes, to enter into any with him. Nor was I fond of Such disputes, but desirous of knowing Something more of his Sentiments I desired him to proceed and told him my rea-Son for making that request.
He continued. He Said most men had a religion of Some kind or other, that tho’ there had been and still was many idolaters in the world, yet even they had a dark confuSed notion of a being, that they could not comprehend. That the more learned part of the world, and the more civilized people, amongst whom the Sciences were cultivated, had discovered this being to be a Spiritual being. That we were extremely addidted to idolatry, and yet had no great inclination for the religion of idolaters. That we are not fond of I	Spiritual ideas and yet are most attached
•	to thole religions, which teach us to adore
a Spiritual being. That this proceeds from the Satisfaction we find in ourSelves, at i	having been So intelligent as to chuSe a
i	religion, which raiSes the deity from that
baSeneSs in which he had been placed by others. That we look upon idolatry as the religion of an ignorant people; and the
religion

SA P H I S on renewing his diScourSe observed, that his Sentiments in many reSpedls, were agreeable to one of our great English authors, whom he had Several times read, having learnt the English language, when young, from a particular f	friend, who had obliged him with Several

That agreeable to that author, there were without doubt many men in the world who had not any idea of a God, at least any that was worthy of him; bsit yet it was ov/ing to their situation, manner of life, &c. and their being abSorbed in pleasures or employed in procuring the conveniencies of life, that So wholly engaged their attention, as left them no j I	time to restedt on a being, who was not
corporeally preSent to their SenSes.
i	|	He observed in the Same author’s
ii;	words, that the visible marks of wiSdom
11	' and power, appear So plainly in all the
! i	works of the creation, that a rational crea-

'll	cannot mils the dilcovery ofa deity: and
the influence that the diScovery of Such a I	being, must necessarily have on the minds
|| i;	of all, that have but once heard of it, is
i‘ I	So great, and carries Such a weight of
! 11	thought and communication with it, that
ij I	it leemed more strange to him, that a

Mr. Charles Guildford. 195,
He continued to obferve according to the Same author, that the deity, having furnished us with thoSe faculties our minds nre endowed with, he hath not left him-Self without a witneSs; since we have SenSe, perception, and reaSon, and cannot want a clear proof of him, as long as we carry ourSelves about us. Nor can we justly complain of our ignorance iii this great point, since he has So plentifully provided vs with the means to diScover I	and know him. So far as is necessary, to the
I	end of our being, and the great concern-
ment of our happineSs.
I	Weil take. Says he, a short view of this
author’s argument, which is So clear, 1 i	think no one will deny the truth of any
part.of it. After observing that to shew, we are capable of knowing, i. e. being i	certain that there is a God, and how v/e
i	may come by this certainty, he Says, I
think we need go no farther than our-Selves, and that undoubted knowledge we have of our own existence.
I	He then proceeds with his argument,
which he condufts in the followino- mast-
I 1	o -
ner.
I think, Says he, it is beyond question,
' ■ that man has a clear perception of his	•
I	VoL. II.	K	own
r

194 MEMOIRS of
own being; he knows certainly, that he exists, and that he is Something.
In the next place, man knows by an intuitive certainty, that “ bare nothing can no more produce any real being,
“ than it can be equal to twp right an-“ gles.” If therefore we know there is Some real being, and that non-entity cannot produce any real being, it is an evident demonstration, that from eternity I	there has been Something, since what was
j '	not from eternity, had a beginning, and
I	what had a beginning, must be produced
jl	by fomething elfe.
I	Next it is evident, that what had its
being and beginning from another, must I ,	alSo have all that which is in, and belongs
to its being from another too. All the powers it has, must be owing to, and received from the fame Source. This eternal Source then of all being, must alSo be the Source and original of all power; and > . So this eternal being must be alSo the most powerful.
Again, a man finds in himSelf perception and Knowledge. We have then got one step farther; and we are certain now, that there is not only Some being, but ' ,	,	-	Some
1.
Mr. CharlBs GuiLDFORb. 195
Some knowing intelligent being in the world.
There was a time then, when there was no knowing being, and when knowledge began to be; or elSe, there has been alSo a knowing being from eternity.
If it be Said, there was a time when no being had any knowledge, when that e-ternal being was void of all understanding. I reply, that then it vras impossible there should ever have been any knowledge. It being as impossible that things wholly void of knowledge, and operating blindly, and without any perception,
■	should produce a knowing being, as it is
'	impossible, that a triangle should make it-
Self three angles bigger than two right ones. For it is as repugnant to the idea of SenSeleSs matter, that it fiiould put in-, to itSelf, SenSe, perception and knowledge, asit is repugnant to the idea of a triangle, that it should put into itSelf greater angles than two right ones.
Thus from the consideration of our- , Selves, and what we infallibly find in our own constitutions, our reaSon leads us to the knowledge of this certain and evident truth, that “ there is an eternal, most ‘‘ powerful, and most knowing being.'"
K 2	I'he
196 M E M O I R S of
Tlie thing is evident, and from this idea duly considered, will easily be deduced all thoSe other attributes which we ought
I	.	•	O
I	to aScribe to this eternal being.
I	But Says he I need not Say any more,
I	as a Christian, addressing himSelf to me, I
I	know your Sentiments, you may in many
I	particulars agree with me, in Some circum-
stances, and thoSe to a Christian material Ones, you may objed:.-—I will not ash you
II	the question, becauSe I think I have heard
and read the most material arguments tiled in Support of the opinions I hint at, and think your learned men have employed themSelves more in the vindication of certain opinions than in making a free and impartial enquiry concerning their truth.
I would have fpoke in defence of the I	impartiality of thoSe writers he mention-
I	cd, but he stopped me : fays he, you
I	need not now, from the natural inclina-
tion of defending your countrymen, and thofe who have wrote on fome of your favourite tenets, fay any thing concerning them.

things without first passing the stridtest examination, on every point ol conSe-quence, and I believe you too honest and ingenuous to deny any re.aSonable proofs brought against you, and you might be foiled. I do not wish to triumph. I have always made it my endeavours to Search out, and pradlice the best religion,
/	and I have in Some Sort formed a religion
for my private praclice, the principles of which, I have mentioned before and which may be simimed up in a few words, viz. “ There is but one God the author of our “ being on whom we are dependent, and “ to whom we are indebted for every “ blessing we enjoy.” That therefore “ we are under the greatest obligations “ imaginable to him, should be always Subservient to his will, and obey all his ,	“ commands.” And I think that the most
(|	perfedl manner of performing our duty
I',	to him and man alSo to compleat the
whole principle consists in ‘‘ ever adSing “ towards all mankind, as we would wish \	“ they should adh, with reSpedl to us, un-
j	“*der the like circumstances”. As to
the external pradlice of religion, I can worship the deity in a moSque, a Greek, a protestant, a Roman, or any other Christi» K 3	an;
198 M E M O I R S of
an church, therefore do not think k-strange that I externally conform to the; worship of my ancestors. It is proper I should do So, for my Safety, for my cha-raiffer,, and for an example to. many who never have an opportunity of refiefUng properly, and for whom even the religion Mahomet has taught, is better than none. I can give you Several examples.

I	countrymen, and particularly among your
I	divines, whole businest it is to teach and
j?	proppgate	the	Christian religion and who.

Such werehhe Sentiments of Saphis, and OSman Seemed to pay a particular atten-. tion to what he Said. As to Onjar, I be-j	sieve he was nearly of the Same way of
I	thinking.

I OBSERVED in my last that OSman paid.
a particular attention to what Saphis had Said, and I must now inform you, that he Several times afterwards brought the Same Subjedt on the carpet, and Saphis i	finding he was desirous of enquiring af~

;	tered into arguments with him, and made
I	many curious observations.
^	You know Saphis and I differed in opi-
nion in Somethings, viz. where I thought he made too free with Some articles of the Christian faith. And though OSman j.	had a much greater regard for me, than
for Saphis, yet as I would not attempt to byaSs his judgment, but wished him to judge for himSelf, Saphis’s arguments, on thoSe Subjedls were we differed, appeared to him the strongest. I was too weak a K 4,.	cham.'

now to return to our own history. We j j	had not yet received any anSwer to our,

i|	VSe had litttle now either to improve or
employ ourSelves, and in facf it was Spendlr i	ing our time in a strange manner.
;t	Saphis discovered our uneasineSs, and

make him acquainted with it. He told i	us it was not convenient for him to lay
‘	down the money for the ranSoni of all of
us, and his father loved money fo well (his greatest fault) that he knew he would not part v/ith either of us without the money was first paid, nor even take his fecurity for our ranSoms, as if he offered it, his father would anfwer, he mi^ht '	as well do it himSclf. But that he
could, conveniently, pay the ranfom of one, and fq>ply him with money for his journey, to go cither to Venice or England and negotiate the affair in perSon,
This was a propofal that our generosity would not Suffer us to accept, nor could we bear the thoughts of parting, and any one of us to beat liberty, and leave the other two in fuch a situation, for now we were three cff us, we did not know ,[	how to pafs our time, what then would
two of us do ?
This prevented us from accepting of the generous offer Saphis had made; Tie fecmed greatly affeCled at his then inca^-pacity of helping us, in fuch a manner as would be agreeable to each of us.
After considering fome time he told us he had thought of Something, that would K 5
£02 MEMOIRS of
give a relief though not a total one, to our uneasineSs; and that was, he would apply to his father, and engage him to let us go with him to ISpahan, where we should '	have a much better opportunity of nego-
tiating for our ranfom. That though he could not gain our liberty on credit yet he could gain So far on his father if he engaged to be anSwerable for them.
We were greatly pleaSed with this pro-poSal, and the first opportunity that offer^ ed he applyed to his father who after much perSuaSion and Saphis having .en-
i	gaged his word and honour to bring iis;
back or our ranSom, without any ec]uivo-cation, he agreed to it.
He immediately informed us of it that j	he might not keep us a moment longer
ij	than he could help, in SuIpenSe. This
I:	added greatly to our pleashre, particular-
f	ly as Saphis intended to Set out for ISpa-
'I	han in a few days.
But how uncertain are all human y	things! Saphis the day before he intend-
y	ed to let out on his journey fell ill, of a

When I found Saphis was in Such imminent danger I went to him, and told him that I, Saw the assistance he had hitherto had, was of no signification; but if he would give me leave to preScribe for him and take care of him, I would life my best endeavours to recover him, as I had Some knowledge of physic and might be of Service to him, though as it was not my profession, I was cautious how I affed, and very fearful of undertaking the care of any one, unleSs in Such a caSe were there were but little hopes of a recovery, and that owing to unssdlful-neSs, for they had but few physicians, and they knew but little. I was fearful of hav-

Saphis was greatly pleaSed at my offer; and readily Submitted himSelf to my care, I need not deScribe a long attendance to you. I by the help of a simple medicine to throw off the fever, and Some powerful restoratives Soon cured my friend, to the great Surprize of his physician, himSelf and his father. His constitution was excellent, and that was now of great Service, for no Sooner had I abated the fever than his constitution operated jointly v/ith my restoratives in a very powerful manner, and theSe restoratives I continued, till he was ,perfe6lly recovered.
And now our hopes were again revived; and our melancholy once more banished. The father was become our friend, on account of the Service I had done his Son. He would have given me my ran-Som, he loved money too well to offer us j	all freedom. And in fadf I might think
mySelf greatly obliged to him, knowing i	his disposition, for the ofihr he had made
me, but however I did not think proper to accept it. I only desired him to fix a reaSonalde ranSom for all, So as that he might not any ways be a loSer by us, and to give his Son credit for that ranSom still-we had an opportunity of paying Saphis
the
2off MEMOIRS of
the money. This he freely conSented to^, and Saphis being ready, to depart, we Set out with Some attendants, and other company, and joining a caravan travelled on-i	by eaSy stages without any accident till
I	we arrived at ISpahan.
I	Saphis gave us our freedom the mo-
I	ment he left his father’s, depending on
j	our honour for the money he was to pay.
i	He alSo accommodated usgenteely, gave
I	us tv/o attendants and Supplied us with
I	what money we wanted, and as he had a,
I ' genteel large houSe in ISpahan desired we I	would take up our residence with him,
during our fca.y there.
Omar as Soon as he arrived at ISpahan, went to his mother’s, and after a short stay returned and desired that Saphis,.OSman,.
‘	and I would accompany him there, that
he might have an opportunity of intro-!	ducing us to his mother and sister.
We complied vfith his request, and '	were Soon introduced to two of the most
;	amiable women I had ever Seen. We Spent
I	Several hours with them in the mostagree-
Iable manner, and when we came to take our leave, Omar and his mother, strongly pressed OSman and me to reside with them, but Saphis kno'wing their circumstances, j	.

As for Omar sit was but reaSonable he I	should stay there, for we could not in juS-

his mother and sister of his company.

OSman and I were left together. I immediately ashed him how he liked Sophiti, Omar’s sister. He anSwered, “ I can Scarce tell what to Say.--If I confeSs I never yet Saw any of the fair Sex, I liked So well, you will anSwer its only a return of my old passion, but I will assure you, my regard for her is very, different from any thing I have yet experienced, and its very well if her being betrothed to that Ger-'	man does not prove to me a very unhap-

,	I was not much Surprized to hear my
friend OSman talk in this manner. I had observed whilst he was in company with i	' Sophia, that he paid a particular attenti-
on to every thing she Said. Sophia was both handSome and genteel. But had she II	been the revdrSe she possessed Such a fund

But I must at preSent drop this Subjedb. Omar early the next day came and gave us an invitation to dine v/ith him. We went and (pent a very agreeable day. We took a view of the city, and as we were passing through one of theprincipal streets, Qmar v/as accosted by a genteel elderly lady, who stopped him a moment, whilst v/e walked gently on.

This was construed as a good omen, and I charged him to improve this favourable .difpoSition in Edzerbeina, and not to be his own enemy, by being too Scrupulous.

Omar with joy accepted the propoSal, and I heartily congratulated him on his. 7

be long before he vrould compleat the affair. He assured me he would not, for the cup might be daSbed from his lips be-I	fore he tasted, unlefs he was expeditious,

The next day Saphis informed OSman and me, that he believed marrying would go on at this time., for that (OSman had -confessed Sophia’s power, and he must honestly conreSs Hacena’s, Sister to Kila-m. We were Surprized ! He informed us,

could first gain Hacena’s conSent, as he would that very day get Omar to introduce him again to the ladies, and give him an opportunity of declaring himSelf to Hacena, who by her behaviour he had reaSon to hope, would not reject him and that then one day should make both O-j	mar and himfelf happy.
I	Here he stopped when Ofman Sighedi

to his happineSs, than there were to Sa-phis’s, just at this moment Omar entered: h	He informed us he had just been paying
a visit to the ladies and that, that day Seven-night was fixed, for his eSpouSing Kilana. We congratulated him on this good news, and then told him he must now lend a helping hand to make our common friend happy.
Omar defired an explanation : we then informed him of what had pasted just be--fore he came in. Omar immediately an?^ fwered, if fuch were his friends fenti--*' ments, he could affure him of SucceSs, for that long since Kilana had in considence told him of Hacena’s meeting Saphis as j	he had mentioned,, that she was then
j	. greatly
Mr. Charles Guildford. 213
greatly pleaSed with him, and having rea-£bn to think she had made an impression on hint, had ever since avoided engaging herSelf, hoping she should Sometime meet with him again, for she did not know him, any more than he knew her, and that after they had the preceding day left the ladies, Hacena had informed Kilana that Saphis was the perfon she had before Seen at the European merchant’s. This gave us all great pleaSure, as we were every one of us nearly interested in what concerned a man, who had been So great a friend to us.
Saphis was that day introduced again to the ladies, and was So happy as to gain both his mistreSs’s approbation and Ed-zerbeina’s conSent, to eSpouSe Hacena the Same day that was fixed for Kilana’s nuptials.
Whilst preparations were making for the celebration of the nuptials of our two friends, OSman Several times visited Sophia. The natural conSequence enSued, for the more he converSed v/ith and knew her, the more he loved her.
OSman SuppoSed that Omar was his sifter’s confident, knowing they had a very great regard for each other. He had I	there-
2H MEMOIRS of
therefore often aSked Omar what Isis sifter’s Sentiments were with reSpe(51; to him but CO no purpoSe, Omar always avoiding the iubjedtwith the greatest care, j	This gave OSman great uneasineSs, as
he imputed it to Sophia’s diOike of him, or at least an indifference for him, and' therefore thought his friend did not chuSe I ' to give him pain by the diScovery. At j	other times the flatterer hope would amuSe
him, with a Supposition, that he was not indifierent to Sophia, but that the obstacle '	that prevented them from being happy'
||	was shch, as there was not a poshbility of
;i	removing, in any manner that would be
I	proper or fatisfa(5l;ory to them, and that
this rendered all their hopes and wishes abortive, and therefore Omar from a motive of prudence, avoided faying any thing that might give encouragement to I	a paffion that must at last prove fruit-
less.
OSman only made Isis complaints to me, being unwilling to give his friends who were’]list going to be happy, any !	pain for him, and thereby interrupt their
j	happineSs without adding any thing to his
own,

However he gave himSelf Some eaSe by communicating his grievances to me-. And though at preSent there was little 1‘	hopes of SucceSs, yet I foreSaw it would

He informed us that Omar out of the fortune he had received the preceding day with his lady, had been offering to pay him for his own ranSom and ours al-So, and that he had refufed accepting of his propofal, becauSe he did not j	think it right to appropriate any part

and much more returned. He now desired our opinion freely, adding, that if Omar had a genteel fortune of his own he might not have wholly refufed his of-I	fer.

;i	ors, but insisted on it shat we should viiot
;|	wait a moment at ISpahan for a remittance
11	of money to pay him : that if we thought
I	proper to wait any time there for our
i;	pieaSure or conveniency it was a different
L	thing, but the moment we were desirous
I'	of leaving the country, he would Supply

‘	purSue our travels, and we might remit
'I	the whole when we returned to Venice or
England.

' and as we did not intend, immediately to leave the country, and were in !,	hopes we fiiould Soon receive remittances,

fettled, we refolved to sit down contented at ISpahan for Some time, to See Somethieg

of the manners, customs, &c. of the Per-I	sians and take a little pleaSure, by way of
I	relaxation, and entertainment after the
I	many fatigues we had undergone.
Scarce five days had elapSed after this, when as we were one day walking out to view a part of the city <3Sman and I had not yet Seen, vrith Saphis and Omar for our guides, Omar met with his uncle,
I	that I have mentioned in one of my for-
mer letters.
He was come back to ISpahan with an intent to leave off buSineSs and Settle there,
!	for he had got an immenSe fortune. We
immediately adjourned to Omar’s, where Omar informed his uncle of all their mist fortunes. The good old gentleman faid, they should not long havecaufe to complain but that he would be a father to them, in the place ofshis deceafed brother. He in, a few days, after having fettled his affairs, divided his fortune nearly into three equal parts. One third he gave to Omar, one third to Sophia, and the remainder he fecured to Omar’s mother, fitould she furvive him, and assured her she should live with him, and he would take the Same care of her during his^ life, as his L 3	bro-
22t MEMOIRS of
,|	brother would have done had he been liv-
ing. This made the family very happy, i|	but Omar and Sophia choosing, as they
I;	were themSelves, by the bounty of their
I	uncle, rendered independant, to place
I , their mother in the Same state, joined in j!	making a very handSome provision for
her.
;:i	The uncle when he was acquainted with
i i	it, laughed, and Said, as they were them-
i	Selves young and no enemies to marriage,
^	-they SuppoSed his sister might marry again,
and that he might likewiSe marry, but as for himSelf he never should think of it,
;	notwithstanding which it was no reaSon his
I	Sister might not if she thought proper,
and he should not wish to confine her to i;	a single life. And in short was greatly
|!i	pleaSed with this testimony of filial duty
I;	that the young ones had given her.
iThe very moment this affair was fettled Omar again called on Saphis and insisted on his accepting of ourranSom, faying his own only objedHon was now removed. Saphis anSwered had he foreSeen it, he should have provided against it, bur, as we v/erc not averSe to the propo-:	Sal, (Omar having by his pressing intrea-
,	'	ties
.1
Mr. Charles Guildford. 223
ties before prevailed on us,) Saphis accepted of his offer and now as they were both ready to Supply us with money, we had nothing but Sophia to detain us in Ferfia.
Olinan was not Satisfied with this, as Supposing I should be Soon for leaving IS-pahan, and he did not know how to stay,
I	and let me Set out for Europe alone,
f	I could not bear to See a friend, I sh
I	dearly beloved, uneaSy, when it was in
my power to give him any relief, therefore to give him as much Satisfaction as I could in this particular, I informed him, *	I would stay at ISpahan Some time longer,
and as he intended to find the German, and endeavour to get him to relinquifn his claim to Sophia before a magistrate, I promised him my assistance, and to wait there patiently till he had brought the I	affair to Some conclusion.
OSman expreffed himSelf greatly oblig-I.	ed to me for this miark of my regard,
‘	which he assured me he should alv/ays
-	esteem as one of the greatest obligations I
could confer on him.
We were now to begin our enquines concerning the German, and here we were at a great loSs. We applied to Omar L 4	to
!' ^ '
I	224. MEMOIRS of
■ to Search among his fathers papers for the I	German’s letter, that we might See if he
had not in that, mentioned the place of ;	his retreat.
We accordingly applied to Omar who :	found the letter, and on examination we
discovered that it mentioned the place of his retreat, placing his confidence, as j	there Said, in the old gentleman’s ho-
nour.
This was one SucceSsful step, and gave OSman very great Satisfaction, as lie^e-steemed it a good Omen for the beginning of our enquiries, the SucceSs of which I shall defer till my next, and at preSent bid you adieu.

LETTER XXIV.
WE had no Sooner gained the information mentioned in my last, then w^e immediately went in Search of the German, to the place mentioned in I	his letter.
When we came there we found he was removed, for fear of being discovered, and it was with great difficulty that we could learn the place he was gone to, and even should not have gained any intelligence, but that Omar made uSe of all powerful gold, a never failing remedy, i	We traced the German, as diredled,
and we;re again diSappointed, for he had made another remove, but gold still befriended us, and we went on from place to place, till at length we arrivca at the 11	place of his residence,

I	ed he was extremely ill, and almost at
the point of death. OSman knew much better than I did, what was to he done and desiring I would stay there im-’ mediately left me. In about half an hour he returned with one of the principal magistrates, who on his entrance de-L 5	mantled

'	We Saw the German extended pale and
i	wan, and almost worn out, on a wretch-
ed bed : the furniture of the room was as wretched, and every thing about us bore the most horrid appearance of extreme I	poverty: as to the German he was the
ij	pidlure of miSery itlelf. I cannot deScribe
I	the horror of the Scene, nor will I at-
I	tempt it. I shall only mention the princi-
i:	pal particulars. The moment the Germrn
Saw the magistrate he fainted away, and it was near half an hour before he could be recovered.
He at last returned to life, and recovered his fleeting SenSes. With' die most ghastly look I ever Saw, and with the greatest horror and fear strongly imprinted on every feature of his face, he aSked the magistrate if he was come to lead him i	to execution, and begged in the most ab-
I i	jeft manner, that as he had but a few
hours to live he might be permitted to ij	die in his bed.
OSman here interpofed, and affured j	him, he should die in peace, that.no one
i	should
Mr. Charles Guildford. 22*7
would molest him, and that we only came to request him to do an a6t of justice, and make Some retaliation to an injured Sami-ly before he departed this life.
Oh ! Says he, you mean the family of my noble, my generous friend Omar whom I have indeed greatly injured. All I	the retaliation that is in my power I will
make, but what can a ruined miserable I	wretch like me, do to Serve them. I have
robbed that family in the most cruel manner, reduced them to poverty, and the greatest distreSs, and now am myfelf just-I • ly punished, for should I recover from this illneSs, yet, I should die with famine, not having wherewith to Support me, and I	the want of the common necessaries of
i	life has been the principal cauSe of my
IpreSent illneSs having jo far overcome me.
The moment OSman heard this he Sent for a physician, and gave the German a purSe to Support him at preSent, with a a promiSe of farther assistance.
I	Fie then informed him of the cauSe of
our coming. The German with very great Satisfaction conSented to his request,' (	an instrument was immediately prepared

I	lemn manner returned thanks to the deity
I	who had given him this opportunity of
doing an adl of justice to a branch of the injured Omar’s family.
I	He then informed OSman that he was

I	that though it was too late to Save his
ij	life, it would pay his debts, and bear his
if	funeral Txpences, and that was all he

LETTER XXV.
Trueman had brought me the agreeable news that my parents and friends were well, as was Charlotte alsh, and unengaged, but had preServed her freedom with very great difficulty. My sister had wrote to me that she had delivered my letter to Charlotte who was I	greatly affedled at my misfortune, and
Spoke of me in the most tender manner. My friends were greatly alarmed at my Situation, but Trueman assured them if they would let him be their messenger, S	he knew So much of the manner of travel-
i	hng, &c. that he could Soon get to us,
S	and would anSwer for the conducing us
t	back in Safety. This had in Some Sort
made them eaSy.
j	After I had made all my enquiries con-
.	cerning my friends in England, &c, I
now enquired concerning affairs at Ve-'	nice and what happened after we were
I	missing.
He Said the men that went w'ith us, af-ter using their utmost endeavours to find us, at night returned to the ship, when the captain finding they were returned *	with-

the moon roSe,.for he judged we had been Surprized by the night coming on before we expedleti it.
^	Trueman desired he might go with
them. They went and waited till Sun rising; when Trueman propoSed that Ibme of the men should go back with the boat to the ship and desire the captain to fend them Some more men that they might I	be divided into Several parties, each to
take a different way up the country and proceed in Search of us.
^	Ishe captain readily conSented, left the
i	Snip under the care of one of his officers,
, .	took two others, with him, went himfelf
:	on shore with as many men as he could
1	Ipare, and took with him arms and am-
munition for the whole. V/hen he landed he divided his men into four finall.par-I	ties, one he commanded himfelf, one
Trueman commanded, and two officers '	headed the other parties : then they Sepa-
i	rated, each travelling a great way up the
country, where they Spent the whole day in a fruitleSs Search after us. They paffed a Second and a third day in the Same man-

ner and then gave us up as lost, SuppoS- , ing we had in the night fell into the Nile. But the captain on restedlion told Trueman he was of opinion wc were taken by Some straggling robbers, and he made not the least doubt but that he should hear from us. Soon after he got to Venice, where he advifed Trueman to go and wait for our return, or at least till he heard from us.
Trueman had fecured every thing that belonged to us at Venice, taken every proper precaution, when not being employed, he could not -stay there any longer, being very un.eaSy at not hearing from us, and for that reaSon Set out for England.
Two days after Trueman arrived at IS-I	pahan, Ofman and Sophia were married,
.and now we had nothing to detain sis there, only it was proper to stay a lit-I	tie longer out of a compliment tothe new
I	married pair, particularly to Sophia,
!	whom it would have been cruel to have
I	immediately deprived of the pleaSure of
^	the company and converfation of her
friends.
I wanted to Send to England to inform my friends of our fafety and of Trueman’s

and good nature that was imprinted on his countenance, and by his genteel ad-dreSs and behaviour.
I thought I knew Something ot his features, and I, for that reaSon took the liberty of enquiring into his name and fa-j	mily.
I found his name was Thompfon and that he was a very near relation of my .	worthy friend of that name, the clergy-
Iman I have mentioned in my former letters. I passed an examination on this young gentleman as to his abilities, &c. in trade, and had great reaSon to be Satisfied ; I then deSired him to call on me in two or three days. In the mean time I ap-[	plied to Saphis, alSo to Omar and his un-

AS the manner in which we Spent the hours at ISpahan during the rest: of J	the time we staid there, will afford you
little entertainment, I will give you : j	Some curious particulars that Saphis made
.]	me acquainted vrith, and which I dare
Say will afford you much more fatisfac--i	tion.
i i	I have already given you his charac-
i	ter, and I believe mentioned that he had
travelled much, and converSed with many Sensible men, of various nations. That by his inquisitive temper he had acquired I	a very	great fund,	of	knowledge which
i	might	be Said to	be	almost univerSal,
!	especially as do geography, 'History, &c.
and the laws, manners, ■ and customs of most of the people, we have any adequate knowledge of, and even of Some that we at this time know little of.
!:	I fiiall not repeat the particulars of all
j	our conversations, as it would to you. In
I	writing be tedious, nor shall I write by
j . way of dialogue, as that will be too pro-i lix, and would oblige me to introduce !	perSons,

perSons, which will to you as a reader be disagreeable.
Method I must likewiSe beg leave to avoid, as time will not permit me to observe it, therefore shall only enumerate 1	Such particulars, which I think are worthy
observation, as they occur. To proceed therefore, the particulars I hint at, were without farther preamble as follows.
As we were now in the Empire of Persia, my first enquiry was concerning that famous city called by the Greek and La-I	tin authors PerSopolis, but by the Persi-
j I	ans and other oriental people, called E-
j'	lamis, and was informed that this city
:	was, when in its perfedlion, the Metropo-
lis of the known world. It was then allowed to be the richest, noblest:, and '	most beautiful city on. earth. That its
'	strudlure was Superb the greatest part of
its buildings being compoSed of cedar and CypreSs: the order of its building was So curious and regular, that it was then justly called, the glory of the world.
S	When Antiochus Epiphanes, had by
S	plunder obtained at JeruSalem ten tuns of
: I	goldi ste marched to PerSopolis with his
army in hopes of getting the greatest i	booty in the world ; and though Baby-
I	Ion
[■	Mr. Charles Guildford. 239
Ion and ShuSan were very rich, in one of which the Macedonian got 50000 talents, and in the other nime millions of gold, as I	alSo 50000 talents in Bullion ; yet in Per-
Sepolis there were found 120000 talents '	or according to others thirty-two milli-
ons Seven hundred and fifty thouSand pounds.
Ij	As to the lofty palace of the Persian
■	emperors, its Situation, proSpeD, rich-
neSs, and the curious arts employed there-!	in, they were incomparable, and threw
j	Alexander into the greatest amazement
when he entered it.
And its not any wonder my friend, that a Macedonian prince should be astonished i	at So much magnificence.
: j	Yet my friend this rich, this famous
city, and even this Superb palace, worth :	perhaps more than the hereditary domini-
ons of that vain conqueror, or rather Madman, was at a drunken feast, in the i	heigth of a debauch, by the instigation
of that wretch, known to us by the name of Thais, at the command of this he'o,
Jl whom we abSurdly call Alexander the great. Set on fire, and reduced, to ashes. An addon So inglorious to his memory, , j that left an indelible Stain on his name,

ed the destrudlive flames he had kindled,
1 • • • * (if possible) with his tears.—A pretty at-
tonement indeed, for Such wanton jcru-i	elty.
Next to SuSa, or ShuSan. This was a place famous for one of the three royal !	palaces, belonging to the Median mo-
narchs. It was here Ahashnerus kept his court, as alSo feveral other kings. Here :	Alexander married Statyra daughter to
Darius. Here he made a feast for 9000 guests, to each of whom he gave a cup of gold. Hei he got 9000000 of coined gold and 50000 talents in Silver. It is situated on the river Choaspis, the waters, of which river were in fuch esteem with !	the Persian Emperors, that they ufed no
; I	other. Here Cyrus the great entertained
i	the beautiful Parthea. Here Alexander
I	gave 10000 talents, to pay the debts of
'	thofe who were desirous of returning into
I	Greece, and here he received a recruit of
30000 young Soldiers. At this place it was, that (according to Scripture) Esther obtained So much favour for the Jews, and Haman was hanged instead of Mordecai.-It is Slid that the palace of Sufa, built by
Darius
I
Mr. Charles Guildford. 241
Darius, was enriched by Memnon, with the Spoil of the great and noble city of Thebes in Egypt, and that the stones were cemented with gold. How far you will credit this I cannot tell. However, excepting that at Perfepolis, stwas esteemed one of the most Superb structures, belonging to the Kings of Persia.
,	This city is now deSolate.
As to the procedure of Ahashuerus’s with regard to the Jews, and his allowing them the liberty of defending themSelves, instead of recalling the I	Sentence, I Scarce have occasion to inform
yon, that Such was the stupidity of the Persians, relative to the will of their Sove-
i reign, that whatever laws they make, or whatever commands they give they are irrevocable, as Supposing they are infal-liable, and the most cruel order given by their monarch, even when drunk, could not be revoked when Sober.
As to SuSa let me notice one thing more before I quit it, which is, that Va-renius mentions a little well atSufa, which makes their teeth fall out that drink thereof. As to this I cannot tell what to fay, ns I could not learn, but would Sooner VoL. II,	M	Submit

we know little of, and from which all Christians (the Dutch excepted, if Such you can call them) are excluded by a Severe edidt. P'or this reaSon, and as I can inform you of Some particulars, known to few, I hope to afford you Some entertainment.
In the philiSophieal tranSadlions, N°. i ;	118, you will find it mentioned, that
I	whether Japan be an issand, or annexed
to the land of Jeffo, the inhabitants of ‘ i!	both countries doubt; becauSe vast and

by an arm of the Sea. I'he ChineSe affirm that Tatary runs 300 China leagues be-I	yond their famous wall; So that if we
follow them, the country of Jeffo, and al-fo Japan, may Seem not to be Ifiands but annexed to the continent.
Japan

Mr. Charles Guildford. 243
Japan lies eastward of Asia, not far from China, and is in a great meaSure, if not wholly Surrounded by the pacific ocean. It is equal to, if not larger than I	Great Britain. Some compute its length
!	at above Seven hundred miles. Its breadth
!	in Some places 180, or 200. I'he eastern
part of it fronts California in America, from which it is computed to be 4200 miles distant. Some think they communicate, but I believe they are greatly mistaken.
j	The Emperor of Japan, according to
the custom of Eastern prince’s, hath Seve-I	ral wives, however, contrary to others,
I	only one bears the name of Midai, or Em-
i	preSs, she hath her own court and palace in
>	particular, Separate from The Emperors,
i	He is obliged by a law of the country to
eSpouSe the daughter of the Dairo, or chief priest. When there is one who is marriageable, and then she, preferable to all other eastern princeSs’s, takes the title of empreSs which is contrary to other oriental states who give this title to the first of the Sovereign’s wives, wsho bears him I	an heir to the crown, and if Such heir

I must observe to you, that the Dairo,
I	is by hereditary right, legal heir to the
crown, but his ancestoi's having been de-poSed, the Successors of the first uSurper, have kept possession of the civil, and left the ecclesiastical power, and many external marks of honour to the Dairo’s and their SucceSSors.

Several Emperors, uSurpers of the Em-:	pire have entertained very great hatred to
Christianity, (which had formerly made a great progreSs in this nation) and to the i '	professors, and in 1639, an edidt was
published at Macao, whereby the Portu-!	gueSe where forbid, on pain of death ever

LETTER XXVII.
I Will beg permission to continue my account of the JapaneSe, and to proceed without farther ceremony.
The Emperor of Japan is a defpotic psince. His will is the only law by which his fubjedfs are governed, however there are certain general customs that prevail as !	laws, i. e. where the monarch adls, in
I	punishing crimes, &c. and according to
the method uSed by his predecessors. His will is So absolute that no one dares op-poSe it, or make the least remonstrance to him. He regulates affairs of conSequence by the ministry of his principal mandar-I	ins who are his chief oshcers, and always
I •	attend him: their Sole employment is to
I	be the depositary of his orders, to reduce
i	them into arrets and edicts, to publish
i	them, and to take care as well by them-
I V	Selves, as by their deputies, that they are
I	executed through the whole empire.
I	The provinces are governed by Vice-
;	roys, whoSe dignity is hereditary but not-
I	withstanding that, Chancellors are Sent
from court into thoSe provinces, to Super-intend the condiidt of Such Viceroys who are obliged to take the ad-
the
! 1	Mr. Charles Guildford. 247
I	vice of thoSe chancellors, in tire ad-
j	ministration and government of public
1	affairs.
'	The revenues of the Emperor are Said
to amount to 28^ millions, of which he does not Spend a 3d. part in the Support of I	his troops and the expences of his court
j	and state; the remainder is deposited in his
treasuries at Jedo, which are guarded with great care, and there it remaines, in Several great towers appointed for that ’ .	purpoSe, and which must contain immenSe
:	riches, having been there accumulated
for a great number of years,
.1 think my friend, a bold adventurer, with a good force, who could make liim-;	lelf master of this treaSure, might with
eafe get the crown, for which reaSon, if !	I was emperor of Japan, I would not keep
Such a treaSure amassed together in one place, under the care of any one body of men whatever. I would diSperfe it in various places, and conceal it as much as ,	possible from the knowledge of any, who
might be in other refpedls powerful ^	enough to be my competitors,
I i	I shall not enumerate the provinces of
this empire, or other fuch like particulars ij	M4	of
/
24§ M E M O I R S of
of this state, as they will afford you little entertainment and as you can readily apply to proper authors for a knowledge thereof, but shall only mention Such things as you may not perhaps be acquainted with, and then proceed to o-thers, that may to you, be more interesting.
The Emperors of Japan generally af-fume Some famous name as a part of their title,, Such as Kombakundono Signifying Sovereign lord, or TaikoSama signifying Grand Seignior or master of the Empire.
I	The Japanefe are idolaters, and worship
the Sun. There are amongst them different fedls to the number of twelve. .Dis immaterial to mention the particulars.
Meaco was the ancient residence of the Emperors, but Jedo is at preSent. The Emperor resides at Jedo, and the Dairo' resides at Meaco, where be keeps his palace and court.
They have ten un-iversities or public Schools, where ) outh are taught elo-' quence, histoiy, astrology, poetry and '	arithmetic. There is alSo a famous uni-
versity at Takufangin, and Several academies of Bonzes, where the Sciences are cultivated.
Among
Mr. Charles Guildford. 249
Among the JapaneSe, almost all crimes are punished with death, becauSe they look on any diSobedience to So great an Emperor, as an enormous crime. The punishment is not intended to corredt the guilty, but to avenge the prince. Thefe ideas ariSe from extreme Servitude, and more eSpecially as the Emperor is Sole proprietor of all estates real and perSonal, almost every crime that is committecl is against his interest-
They punish with death any one who is guilty of a lie before a magistrate; a thing which is contrary to natural defence.
That which hath Scarce the appearance of a crime is Severely punished, and what is very Surprising they punish with death any one who hazards his money at play;
Its very well for many of our fine modern ladies my friend, that we have not Such a law in England. I fear, if Such a law was to be made, it wmuld if possible heighten the Spirit of gaming.
I'he japaneSe are a strange people. They diSregard the greatest dangers and misfortunes, and will on very trishng occasions rip rhemSelves up. Do Such pu-
nishmcnts as I have before mentioned cor-
M 5	reel:
_ 250 MEMOIRS, of
I	red: them ? Or is not death rather ren-
dered familiar than terrible to them ?
The JapaneSe Say, with relation to tha education of their children, that they should be treated mildly otherwiSe they may be rendered refradious to their parents : that staves ought not to be treated too roughly, otherwise they may stand on their defence, &c. By the Spirit which , ought to reign (on Such principles) in ,	their domestic government, cannot they
judge how they ought to ad in political and civil government ?
A wiSe legislator would endeavour to lead the minds of the people to a proper point, by a just temperature of rewards* and punishments, by maxims of philoSo-phy, morality and religion adapted to their charaders, by a just application of the rules of honour, and by the enjoyment of constant good, and of a Sweet tranquility. But under a deSpotic power they have not recourSe to Such amiable,
:	Such gentle means.
MonteSquieu in his curious treatiSe de ■	L.DSprit des Loix, L. 6. cap. 13. (where
you will See a particular account of the a-bove laws, &c.) mentioning one of their Emperors whom I shall preSently from ano-!	ther
Mr. Charles Guildford. 251
ther author particularize) Says, he neglected to marry, and gave himSelf up to infamous pleasures, by which means he ran I	the riSque of dying without a Successor.
.That the Dairo Sent him two very beautiful daughters ; one of whom he married through reSped:, but did not consummate his marriage. That his nurSe Search-!	ed for the most beautiful women; all
I,	was uSeleSs; at length the daughter of an
I	armourer pleaSed him; he determined him-*
Self, and had a Son by her. The ladies of the court irritated at the preference given to a perSon of Such low birth, Smo-I	thered the child. The crime was coni'	cealed from the Emperor, becauSe he^
;	would have shed a torrent of blood. And,
I	as MonteSquieu justly obServes, the ciu-
!	elty of the laws prevent their execution
I	and when the piiniSnment is beyond mea-
'	lure, they are often obliged to prefer im-
!	punity.
So stir MonteSquieu. lii Some other n -Speds the author of the work intitulec.
I	I.e.s Souverains du Monde, published a,
Paris, V. 5. §.2. Art. 7. is rather more: particular.
This Emperor wasToxogunstimia, who Succeeded his father KonboSama in 1631, M 6	and

and was the Same who massacred the Portuguese, as I have mentioned before.
He informs us that this wretch was averSe to women, and besides possessed a ' detestable inclination : that at length determined to have a Successor to his empire, he eSpouSed the daughter of a simple working armourer, by whom he had a Son, whom he left in his infancy, dying in 1653. That the Grandees did not think it proper to acknowledge him as heir to the crown, thinking they should be dishonoured, if governed by the Son of a woman whoSe extraction was Ib low: that they therefore preferred (^lane, a near relation of the last Emperor,ashgning I	him five tutors for the administration of
I	affairs during his minority. He obferves
I	of this prince that he was worthy of his
crown and afted with great wifdom and I	good order in his government, and that
the Europeans might form new hopes of ;	once m.ore gaining admittance into that
empire. As to this I believe, if they did they have been difappointed. As to the '	death of the armourers grandSon, I ima-
gine we may prefer MontsSquieu’s account. As to the reft of the account given by the author of Les Souvereins
du
I
Mr. Charles Guildford,
du Monde, I imagine we may depend upon it, as I have found him very just in many other things But to return to the laws and customs of theSe people.
The JapancSe rejeft pecuniary pains, becauSe the rich would elude the punishments due to their crimes. But v/ill not the rich fear the loSs of their fortunes As to the reaSon why the JapaneSe hate the Christian religion. MonteSquieu observes-, L. 25. cap. 14. That the MagiS® trates look on the constancy which the Christian religion inSpires its proSeffors I	with, when they are desired to renounce
!	their faith, as a very dangerous thing:
they imagine it augments their audaucity. The law of Japan punishes Severely the least disobedience. They order any one to renounce the Christian religion ; if they do not renounce it, it is a diSobedience ; they punish this crime, and the continuation of this disobedience appears to them to merit another punishment.
Punishments amongst the JapaneSe as mentioned before are regarded as the vengeance of the princefor an inSult committed against him. Tlie Songs of our i: '	maatyr’s appear as an outrageous inSult to
:	him. The tide of martyr irritates the
magistrates

But my friend it remains a doubt whether the Christian religion, which our devotees are ib fond of propogating is a-dapted to every form of government, ak
I	lowing (what I Scarce know how to allow)
that it is adapted to every climate, and to the manners, customs, and connedtions, &c. of the various and innumerable inhabitants of this terraqueous globe; So widely different from each other in different nations. If not, I would beg leave to propoSe a question to thoSe who are more capable of judging of this miatter than I am viz. Whether under the pretence of propogating our religion among foreigners, we have any right to Subvert the established form of government of any state (which must, as it appears to me, be often the cafe) against the will of the princes and rulers of Such people, to an-Swer Such purpoSes, especially, as the pro-testant Christian System, allows, agreeable to reafon, that thoSe who do not profeSs Christianity, may be Saved, as well as us?

MonteSquieu L. 25. c. 15, treats very judiciouQy on the propagation of our religion in,far distant countries, andjust-'	ly observes it is not to be wondered at if
foreign princes often forbid the introduction of new religions, and the making of fuch innovations, as it is too often pro-dudlive of intestine troubles.
Foreign princes often admit the Euro-;	})eans into their states, that they may reap
advantages from their knowledge, commerce, &c. But certainly a judicious prince will not tamely Submit to the extirpation of the established religion of his country, (which may tend to the Subversion of his government, and perhaps to his own extirpation by drawing on him the vengeance of his Subjedts, for his tame Submission to Such innovations,) especially when their own religion may *	be properly adapted to their climate, laws
I	manners, customs, connedlions, and ma-
ny other circumstances.
I fancy our European Christian princes would not approve of the Turks, Persians or ChineSe, introducing themSelves a-mong us, with intent to convert us to I	their manner of thinking.

I am certain the religion of any of thoSe people woukl not be agreeable to the English government, and why Slioulcl ours be agreeable to any of theirs. I should be very glad to fee a proper religion introduced amongst all mankind, but I would not wish for any individual to be rendered unhappy by it.

IT\ O vary my SubjeD, my friend permit me to make Some observations on the empire of China, the laws, cuS* toms, and manners of thoSe people, &c.
Saphis
!
j|
I	Mr. Charles Guildford. 257
Sapliis had formerly been intimate with a Senfible ChineSe. The foil own ng observations are the Sruits of Such acquaintance, and of Some reading, &c.
The climate of China is Such, that it greatly favours the propogation of the human Species. The women are extremely fruitful, inSomuch that it is aliedged they have not, in that reSpedl, their pa-f	rallei on earth. The most cruel tyranny
II	cannot stop the progreSs of propogation.
(Notwithstanding the tyranny there practised, China, is by reaSon of its climate,
I	&c. always peopled, and for ever tri-
I	umph’s over the tyranny of their	govern-^
j	ment.
China, like all other countries, where rice is cultivated, is Subjedl to frequent famines. It requires great labour to wa-j	ter and take care of it, and consequently
employs many people. The greater the number of hands employed there is the ;	lefs proportionable share of land for the
\	Subsistence of reSpestive families.
When the people are distressed with j	famine, they diSperSe themSelves	in Search
'	of SubSistance ; they form themSelves in
different parts into parties of three, four, or five, and commence robbers. The
greater
I
!
I	258 MEMOIRS of
I	greater part are at first Suppressed,^ and
perhaps exterminated, others encreaSeand are likewise exterminated. But in So great a number of provinces, and where they are far distant from the court, it may Sometimes happen that a band may meet with good fortune. They Support and strengthen themSelves, gradually en-creaSe into an army, go immediately to the capital, and their chief mounts the throne.
Such is the nature of the thing, that a bad administration there is immediately puniSned. DiSorder Suddenly ariSes joe-cauSe a prodigious number of people want SubSistance. The reaSon why abuSes I	are not So readily punished In other coun-
tries is, they have not Such a SenSible ef-:	fedt; the prince is not So Suddenly in-
!	formed nor in So forcible a manner as in
China,
The Emperor of China is not taught as our princes are, that if he governs ill, he will not be happy in a future state, and leSs powerful and poorer in this. It is ne-ceffary that his government should be good, or otherwise he will loSe his empire and his life.
As
1
I
'	Mr. Charles Guildford. 259
'	As notwithstanding the exposing of
children, the people every day encreaSe in China, it requires indefatigable labour, to make the earth produce Sufficient for -	their nourishment. This requires of the
government Such a particular attention as is not found elSewhere. It is therefore always a point of the greatest con Sequence that every one may purSue his la-I	hours without fear of being deprived of
i	the fruits thereof. This government
ought therefore to be rather domestic than j	civil.
j	The principal objedt of the legissators
'	of China, considered as Such, is to caufe
the people to live in tranquility; they are I	desirous that men should entertain a great
I	reSpedl for each other, that each individu-
al' should be always Sensible that he owes I	much to others, and fhat there is not any
'	citizen whatever, but hath, in Some re-
Spedl a dependance on Some other fel-:	low Subjedt. They therefore give to the
I I	rules of civility the greatest extent.
So amongst the ChineSe, we See that even j	the villagers uSe among themSelves, the
I	Same ceremonies as the people v/ho move
in a higher Sphere do ; very proper means for inspiring affability, ancl a certain Soft-
neSs
!
2£ib MEMOIRS of
neSs of manners So necessary to render life agreeable, to preServe among thoSe people, peace^ good order, and unanimity, and to prevent their running into thoSe vices which are the necessary effecds of voracity. In fa6t to free a people from rules of civility, is opening a door to many errors, and I may Say vices. Civility is a kind of barrier which prevents men from co’Tupting each other.
The different charadlers of nations are-compoSed of virtue and vice, good and bad qualities. The happiest compositions are thofe from whence the greatest good reSults.
The precarious life of the ChineSe, renders them extremely aAive, and gtees
I	them an excessive desire of gain; that no
commercial nation Whatever can depend upon them.
This acknowledged infidelity hath preserved to them the commerce of Japan ; not any European dealer daring to aft under their name, whatever facility there might be in’ the attempt by their maritime northern provinces.
In China they punish the fathers for the faults of their children. The Same
Mr. Charles Guildford. 261
at Peru. This is an effed of deSpotic • power. In China they Say, they punish the father for not having made a proper ufe of the paternal power which nature hath established, and which the laws hath augmented: this necessarily SuppoSes that the ChineSe have not any idea of what we call honour. Among us the fathers whoSe children are condemned to punishment, and the children whoSe father’s have been Suljefted to the Same fate, are fufficiently puniSned by I	shame, whereas the punishment in China
is lofs of life.
Montefquieu^ L. 7. c. 6. treating of luxury, efpecially with reSped to China fays, fumptuary laws are, for particular ;	reaSons, in fome states absolutely neceffa-
j	ry. The people by reaSon of the cli-
mate may become So numerous, and on the other hand, the means of fubsisting ,i	may be fo uncertain, that an univerfal
culture of the land, may be abfolutely :	necessary. In fuch states luxury is dan-
gerous, and there, fumptuary laws ought !	to be rigorous. Therefore, in order to
\	know whether luxury ought to be admit-
ted or prescribed, we ought first to view
the
: i
I i . I
2.62 M E M O I R S of
the relation Subsisting between the number of people and the means of living. In England the Soil produces much more grain than Is necessary for the nourishing thole who cultivate the lands, and who procure cloathing. They may therefore have frivolous arts, and consequently luxury. In France Sufficient corn is raiSed for the Support of the labourers, and thoSe who are employed in the manu-fadlories. Farther commerce with strangers may for frivolous things Supply So many necessary things, that they need not fear luxury.
At China on the contrary, the women are So fruitful, and the human kind multiply So fast, that the lands, however well i	they are cultivated, are Scarce Sufficient
for the nourishment of the inhabitants. Luxury there is, ‘ consequently pernicious I	and the Spirit of labour and ccconomy is
there as requiSite as in any republic I	whatever. They must therefore attach
i	themSelves to thoSe arts that are neceS-
j	ceffary, and avoid thoSe that are volup-
:	tuous.
See the Spirit of thoSe fine ordinances of the ChineSe emperors. “ Our ancestors,”

tors,’* Says an Emperor of the family of Tang, “ held it as a maxim tltat if there was any one man who did not labour,
“ or any woman who was not employed,
“ Some one in the Empire, would Suffer “ either cold or hunger.” And upon this principle he cauSed an infinite number of the Bonze’s monasteries to be destroyed.

J	Dynasty, to whom Some precious stones
were carried, that were found in a mine,
)	cauSed it to be stopped up, unwilling to
i	fatigue his people by labouring for a thing
which could not either nourish or cloath them.
“Our luxury is So great,” fays Kiaj-1	wenti, “ that the people ornament with
’	embroidery the shoes of the young boys
!	and girls, that they are obliged to fell.”
So many men being employed to make j	cloaths for one only, is it not the reaSon ^ -
I	that they have many people who want
'	cloathsst There are ten men who eat the
produce of the lands to one labourer, is i	not that the reaSon why So many people
I	want food.
I	In the history of China we find twenty-
!	two Dynasties, i. e. that it hath under-
1	gone
1
•I •
264 M E M O I R S of
gone twenty-two general revolutions, exclusive of an infinite number of lels conSequence. The three first DynaSties were of a long duration, becauSe the state was wifely governed, and the Empire was leSs extended than it hath been Since.
But we may in general Say, that all theSe Dynasties began as well; virtue, attention, and vigilance are necessary in China: they were found in the beginning of their Dynasties, but were wanting at the end of them. In fast it was natural that Emperors who were bred up in the :	fatigues of war, and who arrived to that
heighth by pulling down from the throne !	a family Swimming in voluptuouSneSs,
would preServe that virtue which had I	proved So uSeful to them, and would
dread that voluptuouSneSs which they had ; 1	Seen So fatal to others,
’ j	But after the three or four first prin-
ces,’ luxury, idleneSs, and voluptuouf-neSs would take possession of their SucceS-fors; • and they confine themSelves in !	' their palaces, weakening their minds,
shortening their lives, and their family declining; the grandees elevating themSelves, the Eunuchs gaining credit, they
would

would place only infants on the throne, the palace becomes the enemy of the Empire, an idle people inhabiting it i*uin thoSe who labour, the Emperor is stain, or destroyed by an uSurper, who is founder of a family, the third or fourth Successor of whom, shuts himSelf up in the Same palace.
I	As to the Spirit of the laws of tliefe
I	people. See. I will beg leave to refer
I	you to MonteSquieu, particularly to
L. 19. c. 17, 18, 19, with which you v/ill be greatly pleaSed.
I will only notice one article more, viz. their industry, from Monsieur Destan* des’s essay on maritime power, and commerce addressed to the count de Maure-pas. This author Says, the ChineSe (who far exceed the Egyptians, in commerce, &c.) have rendered their whole country
1 navigable and eaSy of acceSs, by cutting canals of communication from one river to another, and contriving thoSe canals with Such industry, that there is Scarce a town; nay Scarce a villlage which has not the conveniency of water carriage. Further, we See upon theSe rivers, a prodigious number of people, adlive, frugal, wholly employed in studying and carry-j	VoL. II.	N	ing
'
I ’	266 M E M O I R S of
ing on of commerce, and who very Seldom go on shore; and as all theSe people have not any thing but boats of diffe-
Irent figures for their estates as well as habitations, it frequently happens that theSe boats unite and form a kind of Hamlet, which the ChineSe range with Such Symmetry, that they call them with great propriety, Water-Towns. By this means, if the expression may be uSed, the whole nation is in motion; they proceed in their voyages, they avoid idleneSs and indolence, and they never find any thing difficult where prosit (and the author adds) or honour is to be acquired. But I believe as to honour, I mean what the Europeans understand by the term, they know little of it. They are to live by cultivating the land, and by commerce which they certainly carry on in a very extensive manner.
7'he most judicious refieflions I ever me': with, relative to the ChineSe, are made by MonteSquieu, who amongst other things obServes, as to carrying on a commerce with the ChineSe, thoSe who deal with them ought to carry their own Scales, meaSures, &c. for their government acquieSces in their gaining by Sub-

LETTER XXIX.
I S time my friend to reSume the A thread of our own history.
T ou may now imagine, that the tumults of the passions of my Several friends on the interesting occasions I have before mentioned, were now in Some meafure Subsided, and that a gentle calm, a state of the mosh agreeable tranquility took place. —ReaSon once more assumed her Empire, and we began to deliberate on the measures we were to purSue.
The connexions formed among my friends by Hymen and friendship were Something particular. .

Saphis had So much dependance on his father that he did not chooSe to quit the East. His lady’s regard for her mother and sister, made her desirous of continuing at Ifpahan. This he could not (through regard to his father) wholly comply with. At length it was agreed to make ISpahan the place of their general residence, and to Spend a few months every year with his father.
I	Omar’s lady was likev/iSe desirous of
1	residing at ISpahan. This he the more
readily conSented to, as he was fond of obliging her, and likewiSe of continuing in a place where his mother was desirous of passing the rest of her life, and he would not deprive her of the Satisfadlion she received, after her misfortunes in the enjoyment of his company and conversation. Befides he had already Suffered too much from travelling, therefore determined to paSs the remainder of his life, as a private man, in tranquility.
As for Sophia, she had too great a regard for OSinan, to oppoSe his inclinations, which were to paSs with me the remainder of his life, in my happy country: therefore she readily agreed to accompany us to England.
Cur

Mr. Charles Guildford. 269
Our meaSures being thus agreed on, (after we had engaged to carry on a correspondence by letters with our friends,) Sophia, \OSman and your humble Servant attended by Trueman, and Several of OS-man’s domestics, with two female Servants to attend Sophia, after taking an affedlio-nate leave of our friends, (adefcription of which, I must through incapacity beg leave to bmit,) Set off with the caravans for Gomeran on the Persian gulph. There, after a short stay, we took shipping, and after a proSperous voyage through the Arabian Sea, we proceeded through the Red Sea, to the farther end. We then joined Some caravans that were, on our arrival, ready to depart' for Alexandria ; where we arrived in Safety after a tedious journey, which was not the most agreeable I have ever made, but however, we did not experience So many difficulties as we had formerly undergone, and the amiable tamper of Sophia, joined to her good SenSe, rendered this journey, leSs irkSome to us then it would otherwiSe have been. In fad! my friend OSman was happy, and that contributed greatly to my happineSs, I must here beg leave to add, that he, who had formerly Suf-N 3	fered
270 MEMOIRS of
fercd his passions to get the Superiority over his reaSon, now he was entered into the matrimonial state, made one of the best hushands I have ever known.
At Alexandria we took shipping, croS-Sed the Mediterranean, and passed up the gulph of Venice, and after a very pleafant voyage arrived in lafety, at that noble city.
Having Settled our affaiis, and shewn OSman and Sophia the principal buildings, paintings. See. of which there are a fine collection, we made the tour of Italy, arrived at Rome, and there, for a short time, took up our residence.
' After having Seen every thing worthy our notice in Rome, we departed for Paris. On our arrival there \ye dispatched letters to England, that my friends might be acquainted with our Safety, and the place of our residence. Having taken genteel lodgings, fettled ourSelves, and rested a little from the fatigues of our journey, we hired a genteel carriage, and visited Versailles, Saw the w^hole of that noble palace, its gardens, &c.—We were ,	likewise Several times at court, where So-
phia was greatly admired. We visited every place of note, in and about Paris,

and Spent our time in the most agreeable manner. I must confeSs I was anxious to return to England that I might Sec Charlotte, (who engrossed rather too much of my attention) as alSo my friends.
My anxiety everyday encreaSed, but unwilling to disturb the happineSs of Sophia and OSman, I carefully endea* vouied to conceal it from them. OSman, however, who knew the regard I had for Charlotte, discovered the uneafineSs I laboured under, and knowing, from experience, how disagreeable Such a Situation must be, (after having taken a view of the principal things worthy of notice in Paris,) hastened our departure.
An English gentleman, with whom we had contradled an intimacy at Paris, and who was going alone In his own carriage to Calais, having learnt that we designed to Set off for England in a few days, waited for us, insisting, that we should accompany him in his carriage. We accepted his offer, and having made proper preparations for our journey, took leave of Paris.
On our arrival at Calais, we Spent an agreeable day with the gentleman who had favoured us with his carriage, and a N 4	ship
272 M E M O I R' S of
ship then being in the port, bound for Dover, we the next day took leave of him, (he having busineSs at Calais,) embarked, and after a few hours Sailing, (the weather being fine, and the wind favourable,) we arrived at Dover. There, (that we might not be Seperated) we hired a genteel landau, and drove immediately ;	to my fathers’s little Seat, where we were
joyfully received by him, my mother, &c. whom I had before informed of the time I intended to be with them, that they might not be Surprized.
My worthy friend Mr. Honor, and my Sister Lucy (who during my abSence had been blessed with three fine children, two boys and a girl;) and my old friend Mr. Brown, were there ready to receive us: at my appearance, they were So far overpowered with joy, that they for Some moments entirely lost their faculties of Speech.
But I cannot attempt to defcnlbe the Scene, therefore as a painter, I must draw a veil over it.
Tumultuous joy by degrees Subsiding, gentler passions Succeeded.
I must obServe one thing, that my noble friend, the generous OSman, was by all esteemed as my patron, protestor, and
friend
i' i
Mr. Charles Guildford. 273
friend: as one that had Saved me from ignominious Slavery, returned me again to my native country, and the arms of my friends; and as Such, was ever regarded by them.
Every one was likewiSe rejoiced at the fight of honest Trueman,'and being c-^ steemed by all, as my foster father, he was overwhelmed with the profufion of their grateful joy; at the honest old man’s Safe return to his native country.
I enquired of my Sister concerning Charlotte, and was informed she was at that time in London. Bufinefs calls me and I must abruptly conclude.

,	Charlotte came in. I paid my reSpe^s
to her, (avoiding particularity) as an acquaintance, just returned from abroad, but durst not be more particular, in the ■	preSence of Mr. Worthy and his lady.
Our meeting was Such as you may imagine. My eyes Spoke the language of deSpairing love; her’s anSwered me; tho* j	the prcSence of Mr. Worthy and his lady
made each of us endeavour to restrain thoSe talkative things, but to little pur-I	poSe; notwithstanding a diScovery was

j	pitied my situation.
My constitution was not able to bear the violent emotions, which thoSe turbulent pashons of Sorrow, rage and deSpair I	gave me. Nature was almost everpow-

derable time confined to my bed. No one expefled my recovery. In this fitua-;	tion I continued So long, that every

But great as my distrcSs was, judge what it must have been, had I known that Charlotte was like my Self, reduced to the lowest ebb of life, and her death every moment expedted.
Tho she was in this wretched condition, yet by the advice of Some cruel relations, her parents had made a fixed resolution, never to conSent to an alliance between us, if it would Save her from the grave; and their objedtions were, the meanneSs of my birth and fortune, no one knowing me or from whence I claimed my origin.
My friend Mr. Brown, who (as I observed in Some of my first letters) understood many excellent Secrets in physic; did by his extraordinary shill, (after discharging the physicians and apothecary, &c.) recover me, to the very great joy » and Surprize of every one.
I desired Mr. Brown to attempt the cure of Charlotte, though there was no
possi-
2 7» MEMOIRS of
possibility of her ever being mine; yet notwithstanding that, and my late fit or illneSs, of which I was but just then recovering, I found my love was not in the least abated.
I had learnt from a friend in Mr. Worthy’s family, that they had agreed to pro-poSe an alliance between Charlotte, if she should recover, and a young nobleman at court; who would be proud of the alliance, and that they were to be married as Soon as possible, to cut off all farther I	hopes, that either of us entertained, of an
i	alliance happening between us.
!j	Mr. Brown was introduced by a friend:

They trusted entirely to his care. He at-I	tended the fair one Some time, until she

ON our arrival in the country, OS-man would have given me the one half of his fortune, but I refuSed it, aS-Suring him I had already Sufficient to Support me, in all my expences.
His fortune was immenSe. He inSisted om my acceptance of Some valuable jewels. He presented a Set for dreSs, to my mother, another to my sister, and Several jewels to my father, Mr. Honor, and Mr. Brown. TheSe, and Some others, he had got new Set in London, according "	to the English fashion.
He then purchaSed an eState, with a beautiful feat, in our neighbourhood, and with him I Spent great part of my time.

My father thought bufinefs might divert me, and therefore desired me to go with him. My health being tolerably established, I desired my father to Spend the winter in town, he readily conSented, and we had Soon the pleaSure of Seeing the rest of our friendly circle with us.
OSman one day accompanied me in a visit to Mr. Thompfon. Mrs. Thompfon •was dead. The good man was not in very good circumstances; having greatly distressed himSelf by his charitable dilpo-sitioii.
We dined there. MiSs Betfy dined with us. OSman took particular notice of her, and after we had taken leave of them, desired I would introduce Sophia to an ac-

Charlotte was Soon informed of the change in Mr. VVorthy’s Sentiments. The pleasing news had the Same effect on her. She Soon recovered. We met, I need not inform you that it was with infinite pleaSure we once more beheld each other. None but thoSe that have felt the like, can form an idea of our happineSs.
I now recovered my native temper; and pleaSure again became agreeable to me. The Society of my friends was once more pleasing and my melancholy was entirely banished. You may be desirous of knowing how Mr. Worthy’s objections were removed.
Take the following short history of our family. My father was the eldest Son and
heir
Mr. Charles GurimroRD. 283
heir of the earl of B. He was bred up at court. He had a brother and sister Some few years younger than himSelf. He was a very great favourite with the old earl, who indulged him in every thing he desired. His inclinations led him to travel.—The tour of Europe was his choice. He mentioned it to the earl and his lady. They conSented, and furnished him with every thing necessary for that purpoSe.
On his return to England he met with my mother, who was esteemed one of the greatest beauties in the English court. She was daughter to lord D. The greatest part of whoSe fortune was lost, by what means stis immeterial to mention: the rest descended to his Son.
My father loved, declared his pashon, was well received; and treated with honour, and a generous frankneSs; for my mother at first assured him, she was not possessed of a fortune, nor had any exped:ations. This was what he did not. regard, but having gained lord D’s 1	conSent, he applied to the earl of B.
for his, which was refuSed. He, in the heighth of his passion, regarded it not; and against the earl’s expreSs commands,
married the ladv he loved.	This

This entailed miSery on both. The earl disinherited my father, and made his brother heir to the whole estate. My father had then about five hundred pounds per annum, which the earl could not deprive him of: with this he retired into the country, and not being able to Support the dignity of his birth, he concealed himSelf from the world, and affumed the name of Guildford, under which you have hitherto known me, it being my travelling nante.
' ■ I mentioned in one of my former letters a legacy left him, just before 1 went down t6 Bath. .Dwas his Sister who died I	unmarried, that had left him what for-
I	tune she poffeffed at the time of her death .
The earl of B. died a few years after he had disinherited my father, and his Second Son took up his estate and title; under a pretence that my father was dead and that without issue. And enjoyed it, without the least remorfe, for the cruel uSage my father bad received. Until a fever Seized him ; and he Sound his death was near. Having never entered into the matrimonial state, he made a new will, and_therein appointed my father Sole executor, and gave him his whole fortune.

A knowledge of theSe facts are Sufficient to convince you that Mr. Worthy could not, when he was acquainted with the whole, objedt either to our family or fortune. This fortunate revolution, was what my father never expeded, and that was the reaSon he kept his children as well as the world in ignorance, of the family from whence they Sprung, that we might Submit to our fate without knowing it, and consequently without repining.
My father gave me a genteel fortune., and insisted on Mr. Honor’s accepting Such a portion, a,s he would have given with his daughter at her marriage, had he then been as earl of B. poffessfed of the fortune belonging to his title. He like-wife in Some Sort returned the generous OSman’s kindneSs, in preSenting him with Some curious paintings, busts, &c. and other curiosities, of which OSman was particularly fond.
Things being at length ready for the celebration of our nuptials, our friends in general were invited, and we had a grand '	company. My worthy friend Mr. Thomp-
son performed the grateful office for me, and joined me for ever to the woman I loved.

With what pleaSure was that happy day Spent! Yet how long, how tedious aid I think it! Night arrived, and to uSe the words of Milton,
To the Nuptial Bower,
I led her blushing like the morn; all Heav’n,
And happy constellations on that hour. Shed their Seledted influence; the earth. Gave signs of gratulation; and each hill: Joyous the birds: fresh gales and gentle airs,
Whisper’d It to the woods; and from their wings
Flung roSe, flung odours from the Spicy shrub;
DiSporting, still the amstous bird of night. Sung fpouSal, and bid haste the evening star
On his hill-top to light the bridal lamp.

i	After the celebration of our nuptials,
I	and a short stay in town, we retired into
I	the country, where we live as happy as
I	we can wish, free from the noiSy cares of
tumultuous life. Mr. Honor continues I	near us, has Several fine children by his
j	Lucy, and live as happy-as they can wish.

OSman has Several children like wife, by ^	Sophia, and they are as h^ppy as mortals
can be. Mr. Brown is still living, and well. Mr ThompSon resides on the living my father gave him; keeps a curate in the other: and with his income does much good. MiSs BetSy is married to a gentleman in the neighbourhood, and her j	happineSs is equal to her merit.
By Mr. ThompSon’s diredtions, and with his assistance Mr. Honor, OSman, and mySelf; have between us, established a School for the breeding up and educating of a certain number of poor children of both Sexes, where they are provided with every necessary, and taught uSeful knowledge. Sufficient to preServe them from the dreadful effedts of ignorance. When they are old enough to be put out, we intend to have them bound to Such '	handicraft, or other businesses as their in-
clinations may lead them to the choice of; and if they merit our farther bounty when their time is expired; we shall advance, or give them Something, wherewith they may Set up in their reSpedfive callings; and by this means may become uSeful members of Society.

The care of sheSe children is committed to Mr. Thompson, the first promoter ot this charity. In regard to the education of our own children, we purSue Mr. Locke’s and the archbishop of Cambray’s instrudlions as near as we poS-fibly can; and which are methods I would recommend to every parent.
You desired the particulars of my life, I have complied, and hope in the whole it will prove agreeable to you. I am, my dear friend,
