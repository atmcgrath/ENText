INTRODUCTION.	II
EXTRACT OF A LETTER TO THE EDITOR,	■
Dated Chamherry, in Savoy,	■
Jaru 7, 1780.	I
“----------The	original manuscript, an	I
imperfect translation of which I take	■
the liberty to send you, is in the pos-	I
session of a gentleman in this neigh-	I
bourhood, to whom I was presented	I
by our common friend, the Marquis	I
' de Bellegarde.—He was so obliging a^.	I
^ to lend it me for my perusal, and, on my	*
^ proposing its publication, he informed me that it bad been sent to the Editors of the posthumous editions of Rousseau’s ^ works, now preparing for the press, d, who excused themselves from receiving I	A 3	it,

it, because no such work was named amons: those which he intended should appear after his death. However, I	'I
have obtained the liberty to translate and g-ive it to my country.
Rousseau passed a considerable time in this gentleman’s family, and, during his abode there, was continually amusing himself with his pen, the productions whereof he left behind him, by the desire of his friend, who had so	|
kindly received and cherished him.—
They chiefly consist of little tender pieces of poetry, and many of them possess that delicious colouring and affecting sentiments, which he so well knew how to give to any thing, and to every thing.—Among these were the following Letters, written, to all ap-pearacey without much attention, and, perhaps, as the first sketch of a design,
which

which he intended to have rendered more complete and important. They will, however, be found to contain, though in an inferior degree, the simplicity of story, the delusive improbabilities, the enchanting tenderness, the expressive language, and the romantic	I
virtue, of his other works. That much '	I
of their original merit will be evapo-	I
rated in my Translation, I well know ;	I
—indeed I feel and perceive it. Fide-	J
lity is all I can boast.—On that, at least,	1
you may depend ; and, if the sense be	I
preserved, you have my leave and re-	j
, , quest to make any alteration in the	']
expression, which your ear or your heart	!
may dictate. The title is my own ; for the manuscript does not possess a	j
name, but is introduced with the Italian line which preserves its place in the first page.

“ The Marquis de Bellegarde is of	f
opinion that the story has some foun-	\
station in truth, and has been turning	f
his thoughts, but in vain, to the recollection of an unpleasant history	^
of this kind, which happened, as he	'
thinks, many years ago, when he was in England. You will perceive that the name of the gentleman who is the	,
supposed writer of a great part of these	i
Letters, is an English one, thougii disguised by the French manner of spelling, and might lead to a discovery of the event which, as the Marquis imagines, gave Rousseau his subject. It is of that singular nature as to have made some noise at the time it happened, both in England and Italy, and, from its circumstances, not unlikely to have reached the citizen of Geneva during his residence at Venice.

It is also that species of story which	^
would come home to such 'a bosom as	.
liis, and might have been intended to form the ground-work for some exer-	!
tion of his sensibility, which yielded to objects wherein his feelings were	I
more deeply interested, or might be	1
lost in the fancied misery of his future	I
life:—a misery that every humane	J
mind must pity; and, with all its ec-	I
centricities, who is there will avow that	||
he does not respect it}	I
" In consigning this manuscript to	|
your care, I do it the justice which I	i
think it deserves; and, in desiring	|
you to give it to the world, I shall do the world no disservice. In an age like this, when the press teems with	*
works of trifling entertainment, to say no worse, and every provincial town has its circulating library, it is, in
some
t
!
. I
some degree, benefiting society to pre* sent it with publications, which, while they bear the seducing titles of Romances and Novels, convey a moral, and call forth feelings which that species of composition does not always possess or create. If sensibility is a principle fruitful in virtues; if it promotes the love of our fellow-creatures; if it is the antidote of frivolousness, coquetry and selfishness; why should not its empire be extended ? And what	,
sense can there be in opposing a kind of writing, whose tender and affecting melancholy gives to the pensive mind	j
a source of jdelicious sympathy? JMaL	\
s heureux qui raisonnent toujours, et ne	|
sentent jamais que les defauts !
I have seen indeed some, and not a few of those works which are called sentimental, that, without possessing
any
i
I
1
^	I
!
xi	j
any thing	like	nature or moral,	have	i
been able to please and affect a certain	|
species of weak, romantic, unreflect-	'
ing readers. The whole of their merit consists in long-spun apostrophes of love and	disappointment, forced de-	i
scriptions of happiness and misery;	i
while panting hope, trembling fear, frantic despair,	and unutterable	joy,	^
are sometimes to be found in the same page. This work, I trust, will bear another and a more favourable description.—Rousseau, in the preface to his	j
Eloisa, lias declared, that the unmarried	|
woman who reads that work is undone : and, on concluding the perusal of this	j
imperfect but interesting offspring of	I
the same pen, it will be observed, by	|
the reflecting reader, that the young	^
unmarried woman, who suffers herself to commence an epistolary correspon-	|
deuce	■
1
r
i
xii
dcnce with a man of her own age, is guilty of a great imprudence: but that, if she writes one letter to him on the subject of Love, she risques her undoing. These are truths of no small importance to female youth, and the guardians of it.
" That this may be found inferior to the other translated works of its celebrated author, I will readily acknow* ledge but still it was originally written by Rousseau; and I shall not disgrace it by any apology of mine. It is said that the gallipots painted by Raphael are held in high estimation by those who most ardently admire the distinguished productions of that sublime pencil, which has given to itsr
master a name that will never die.”—

It is true, lovely Isabella, that my lips never unfolded to you the feelings of my soul; but in the communication of lovers there is a more affecting language than words can form. To a mind of your sensibility, the expressive look, the heaving sigh, the timid ^	silence, will be more intelligible, and sooner
1	felt, than all the protestations which the
‘	tongue can utter ; and when I have been be-
fore your grate, such a language of sincere and respectful passion must have reached you i	This letter, therefore, will not surprize you:

announce its contents; you will know the ,	errand of the messenger before it is told; and,

the declaration of my distress has awakened your pity, I shall be the happiest and most ;	honoured of men. Ah, Isabella! happiness,

I HAVE waited an age	and you have not	,,
answered my letter; perhaps you never mean to answer it. If I have been guilty of presumption, be kind for once and tell me so:	j i
do not, I beseech you, conceal from me the judgment you have passed on my crime, that	fl
I may haste to breathe my last groan in your	I
sight; and be a melancholy but perfect proof,	H
that, if I was not worthy of your kindness, I did not deserve your cruelty. Mine is not	M
the passion of an hour; I did not yield to it	H
till every trial of reason, absence, and variety,	I
were found to be in vain: I then submitted to	f
a destiny which is irresistible; a destiny which might be happy, and may, perhaps will, be miserable. You, Isabella, are the mistress of it; by your lips it must be pronounced, and	I
I shall bend submissively to their decrees,	I
tliough I may not long survive them.	I
.V I know the difficulties which oppose my	I
H 2	passion;	1

*1	passion; I see the natural impossibilities
X	which stand between me and the object of
*'	my love, which, in spite of them all, en-
> '	creases every minute ;—a sure and certain
^	proof of its growing strength, its powerful
‘ I	impulse, and the vanity of opposition. I have
j	struggled against it as an enemy that would
h	destroy me; I have fled from it as from an
^	enemy I found too strong for me; and, at
length, I am forced to yield to it—must I say, as to an enemy who has conquered and bound I	me in chains from which death alone can de-
‘	liver me! You, indeed, could change them	m
I	into silken bands and flowery garlands ; but
i	you, all gentle and lovely as you are, may
wish to aid the tyrant, and to punish the I	crime of loving with that silence which will
tell me I love in vain. I may find the avenues of your heart more impregnable than the walls	I
ij	of your convent: alas! it may prove a more ,	j
y	arduous undertaking to bribe the firm resolu-
I	tions which guard them, than to melt the
stern, unfeeling portress who locks you from the world.

TO ISABELLA.	i
The trial has been made, and proved in-	|
effectual. I cannot promise even one poor	‘J
endeavour to turn my thoughts from you:	a
my eyes have but one direction, and my heart	' 1
has but one impulse. If my passion for you	|
is a dream, I should wish never to awake;	|l
if it should be a reality, it will never be	||
quenched but by the sleep of Death.
Ah, lovely Isabella! has Misery, then,	11
prescribed the vows which you have taken ?—	1||
Did Sorrow clothe that charming form in the	^
snowy habit which covers it ?—Did Despair	T
lead you to the altar, where your happiness has been sacrificed?—Alas!—does your heart fondly regret some darling object, from wdiich	i
you are eternally separated ?—it must be so— it cannot be otherwise :—the gloom of your	. ^

If	graces about them,	and consign them, with-	;

THE ANSWER.
' I
I	If I consulted the cold, unfeeling oracles of
cautious Prudence (and, perhaps, it were bet-	1
ter for me if I did consult them) I should not	j
have broke the resolution I had taken of never writing to you again; and, though there is a strange kind of romantic sensibility in your ^ ^	last letter, which should awake suspicion, I	1
1	cannot but write once more to you, to offer
my endeavours to soothe it into reason, and recommend to you that sobriety of reflection I	which may restore you to yourself, and turn
T	your thoughts to some more substantial hopes
I,I	of happiness.
>1 r	Alas! Love never reigned in my breast;
I k	thfit torturing deity did not conduct me to the
prison, which I now inhabit: other and far !^'	different passions led me hither. I sought the
gloom of this cell, as an asylum against the . <	horrors of a marriage with the object of my
detestation;
i
<1
f
f
H
detestation; from which I had no means of . escaping but by clothing myself in the habit	\
in which you have seen me.
I was formed for the world; I was educated to live in it, and had already been admitted	d
into some small share of its societies; you	I
will, therefore, imagine that the comforts of	■
this solitude find their principal source in the	y
reflection on the evil I have avoided :---if
memory glances upon any other circumstance	|!
of former pleasure, my heart can scarce sus-	J
tain the poignant mortification ;—my only	1
satisfaction is accompanied wdth terror, and is	tM
like the joy of one, who, having been pre-
served from imminent danger, finds the con-
soiousness of immediate safety disturbed by	^
the recollection of the perils he has lately
escaped. I have only to thank Heaven for
having taken from a situation Avhere I must
have been completely miserable, to place me
in a state where I cannot be happy.
It is true that I am not formed for a monas-	i
tic life; its offices are not congenial to my nature ; my mind cannot confine itself within '	the
13
tlie walls that surround its mistress; it is ever on the wing, and the more awful seasons of prayer and devotion cannot restrain it:—nevertheless, I have made a solemn vow, which must not be broken; it is registered in heaven,
.	whose vengeance would justly pursue me,
1	should I dissolve it. I have possessed, alas !
I	unfortunately for me, those means of instruc-
*	tion, which, in this country, young persons of
my age seldom attain; I have profited of them; and while they have qualified me to feel, in a greater degree, the misery of my situa-i	tion, they ought to strengthen the power of
resisting any temptations to break a vow which (	I believe to be of a sacred nature.
(	Generous stranger! be content with the
i	grateful esteem which I offer to you. Think
^	no more of me, I beseech you. A gulph,
I	which you can never pass, is placed between
'	us. If it can be any satisfaction to know that
I do not love another, it is my wish to impart .	'
^	it to you. But let me, above all things, ex-
hort you to leave this country ; turn from its delusions, and seek your native shores, where,
amid
r
\
13
amid the caresses of your friends, and the du-	;
ties of your station, you will soon lose the temporary image of beauty, which never had much to boast, and is now no more.
You are not yet arrived to that maturity when impressions take root in the mind, and	i
last througli life. The various objects which will excite your esteem, and the important concerns which must awaken your attention,	|jl
w ill aid the natural fickleness of your age, to get l id of an idea which you declare to be so	> I
tormenting to you. I also am young;—but,	I j
having no objects to invite my regard, and	i|||
bound by one dull, unvarying line of duty,	Ilj
the impressions of my youth, such as they are,	'
promise to be those of my life. My heart has	^ |
no pleasing expectations of relief; the melan-choly which guards every avenue of it from	I
the approach of joy will soon corrode it into I	insensibility: but till that period arrives, and
my wishes are disposed to hasten its approach,	'
the idea of your generous nature will not be
forgotten.	'	<

TO ISABELLA.
You are guilty of a cruel injustice to those charms which would render you the admiration of all mankind, if they w ere permitted to bless the world :—every feeling, every sentiment of my nature, cries aloud, that the j	moment I am forgetful of them must be the^
last of my existence.—Beautiful Isabella! are you then formed for happiness, and must you live in misery?—so young, and without any hopes of relief from sorrow but by chilling insensibility?—so instructed, and vet doomed to think that those ties are sacred Avhich render life at once miserable and useless.
The greater part of your sex, who bind themselves by monastic vows, are happy in their ignorance, and, being taught to consider the world as full of danger and misery, think themselves blest in the covert to which they have fled for shelter ; and fuid in the duties of
religion
/
15
religion a calm satisfaction which is not diminished by the remembrance of otlier pleasure:
—but you, who were not intended for monas-, tic life, whose mind was enlightened in order to take a part in the concerns of the world, who were formed by nature for a life of rea-	,
son, reflection, and society, you must possess	j
far, far different feelings.---Oh, Isabella,
when the midnight choir lifts up its voice,	j.
where are your thoughts and what are your sor-	|
rows! Amid your broken slumbers, what pleas-	?
in g object does Fancy sometimes present to you,	ji
to add new disappointment to your waking	r
hours! Can a vow, which binds you to support	|l
such a life be known in heaven ? If so, it must	V
be inscribed in the celestial registry as a crime	y
rather than a virtue ; as a bondage which it would be piety to break, and must be criminal	'ft
to maintain.	jl|
Without entering into any arguments upon	|j
a matter which furnishes so many, let me	,11
persuade you to consult your own reason, and	I
before that tribunal examine the real force and	I
tenor qf that obligation into which you have	|
c 2	entered.	^

16	i
j	entered. Alas! Reflection must sicken at the
rigours of a prison, whose gate freedom is not. suffered to approach but to bear you to your grave. Memory, glancing over the scenes of the past, must act a busy and tormenting part;
—Hope, arrayed in all its visionary colours, as it rises to give a fancied glimpse of pleasure,
is quenched in a moment.------Oh, Isabella!
when the sighs break forth from your bosom, when the tears Avash away the blushes from your cheek, wherefore do you sigh, and why do you weep?
That I love you, and that the happiness of my life, and life itself, is mingled witji my passion is most true; nevertheless, it depends upon your answer to this letter, whether the future knowledge of it is to be with-held from you.—If you are contented and at ease, my voice shall never waft a sound to interrupt your repose, nor shall you again see in my changed and distracted 1‘orm the triumphs of your beauty;—but if you are wretched, let me offer to you ssie means of being happy.	►

sought it to shelter liie from a greater evil.	j
Under the idea of such a privilege, and, at the time, 1 thought it a great one, I took	H
the vow which has wedded me to this	rli
cell for ever with an unfeigned sincerity. I	'
thanked Heaven with the most perfect gra-	1
titiide for thus	delivering	me from the object	■	||
of my hatred, and I bid adieu to a world	ij
which contained him with a most ardent sa“	{
tisfaction. Whatever sentiments, tlierefore^	|
might succeed, when the sense of immediate	I
danger was passed; and whatever inroads	.
discontent might make upon my mind, when	jl
the hurry of deliverance began to subside; I	K

^agements is lessened, or the obligations by	9
which I have bound myself and my life have	9
lost an atom of their force. This is a situa-	■
lion, I must confess, wherein the heart might	|l
exert its power of deceiving with' great ad van-	M
tage; but I am aware of the danger, and	p
shall, I trust, escape it. I may lament the	P
being driven to such a cruel alternative; but,	i
having once decided, the lot is cast:—the	|
choice was an eternal one for me: and, were the means in my power by which I could be	|
free this moment, I would refuse them.
If I had been the mistress of ray fate, and	•
could have ordered the future part of iny life to my own pleasure, I should not have chained myself to a cloister; I should not	, ,
have been so prodigal of happiness as to have	I
remained in a situation wherein my wishes	J
and my duty would have such different objects, whose continual conflict will destroy my repose, and end my being.—But I already see the end of my course, and my wishes are, every hour, shortening the unpleasing path that leads	|

You suffer yourself, charming Isabella!	to	1
:	be led away by a chimera which will undo ,	|
you. It is a crime to be miserable when we have it in our power to be happy. The vow	|
which weds you to Sorrow is false in itselsi	|
as well as contrary to every law of Nature, to every principle of self-preservation,	and	the	j
wilt of Heaven. To fly from misery is more than natural,—it is instinctive; and to avoid
apparent
''TpNr-f
20 1
apparent evil is a principle which governs every thing that has life and sensation. Perhaps there is not in Nature an event so much to be dreaded by a mind pure and tender as yours, as to be forced into the arms of a man who is the object of your detestation. To turn your back upon such an union, and to fly from such a scene of distress, w as the natural result of the first reflection; but your flight has been incomplete, and you are stil unhappy. What, Isabella, with your reason and understanding, can you trust yourself to the paw' of the Bear, because he has saved you from the jaw of the Lion ? Do you call this a deliverance'! Can you be resigned to it, and think it a blessing {—Impossible !
If the real happiness or honour of those who were dear to you could be preserved or encreased by the sacrifice of your liberty, you would have some motives to aid your resolution in making you resign: but, superior as you are to the prejudices of your country, you mock at the pretended wisdom of that un-^ iubstantial, irrational, and, I may add, irreligious
f
21
»
ligious pride, which, finding it could not govern the afi'ections of your heart to its own purpose, was resolved to disappoint them of any 'other.
If you can find comfort in the walls which enclose you, I will never suggesta wish to look beyond them.—More, far more than the half of pleasure is to bestow it; the object must participate the joy, or Love is a brutal instinct that should never be named.
You have seen something of the world, and I can perceive from your letters, as I have observed from your conversation and manners, that you were formed to be the honour, the happiness, and the pride of social life. Hear ven designed you to be a model of perfection to your sex; and will you oppose the designs of Heaven by shutting it from their sight?
Beauty, which expresses itself in the features of an angel,—grace, that enhances the form of Virtue,—smiles, that would charm in heaven,—and words, whose sweetness no musie ever equalled, were not given to be hid in the gloom of a Cloister. You were not cast in
so
k1
T
rr
22
«o pure a mould, and so highly accomplished with every great and rarest charm to be covered with that impenetrable veil y hich hides you from the admiration of mankind. Such a flower was not reared in the fair garden df the world to be transplanted into a solitude insensible of its beauty, and w here its fragrance is w asted. It is tlie interest of Heaven to display so fair and bright a part of its creation; and it is promoting the ends of Virtue to pluck it from the mists which becloud it.
That Being, whose aid you invoked when you pronounced the vow that separated you , from the world, looks with pity on the weaknesses of his creatures, and will not consider it as an offence against him, that Misery sliould break its bondage. It would be a virtue, an heroic, a patriot virtue, to force the bolts that confine you. Think, Isabella, that you are answerable for all the good you might do in the w^orld; reflect how little you can perform where you are; and the false Delicacy which now deceives you will fade away belore the ponvictions of Reason. Do

24
with that of thousands, who are languiihing in various shapes of hopeless misery, my heart tells me that I ought to acknowledge the goodness of Providence in having afforded me a shelter from them.
That I might have been happier, is a mere matter of conjecture; that I might have been more wretched, I have already' confessed; and who will dare to say that it is not a blessing to be thus equally removed from either situation?
Are not the apprehensions of distant evil frequently disappointed by some unexpected alleviation; and are not the hopes of happiness equally liable to be deceived by tlie distant appearance of their objects? Thus it is that supreme Wisdom appears to preserve abalance in its dispensations to the human race. Alas! if the sum of happiness could be ascertained at the close of life, there would not be that difference between the final accounts of those whom the world determines to be happy and miserable, as that world may imagine. ,In the present delirium of your passion, you are
deceived
(
deceived into a belief that its gratificatioft	I
would not be accompanied with the faintest	I
gleam of infelicity. Alas! that reason, by	I
whose oracles you urge me to be admonished	|
and directed, will tell you far otherwise;	|j
Religion is ready to confound such a faith ;	,
and human Experience, if I have been rightly	t
informed, would be entirely and universally against you.	y
I wish you very much to consider, whether,	f
though it may be natural, it is always right, to leave one’s wretchedness: there are, surely,	J
situations were to fly from misery would be	n
a mark of cowmrdice, and be stigmatised with	N
disgrace. What is that principle which men	I*
call Honour; which I have heard mentioned as a bond of superior obligation; which will	b
urge your sex te deeds of extreme hardship and equal danger; for which fortune, ease, and even life itself are often put to the hazard?
Reflect a little upon this question, and then consider the vows which a Nun takes, as well as the solemnity which accompanies them, on her assuming areligious life; after this, you will	1
D	ba
. j
-— •	—t
be forced to acknowledge, that it wpuld betray	I
a want of principle, disgraceful in the highest degiee, to break such a solemn engagement.
The compulsion sometimes used by parents on such occasions may be urged to invalidate its force; and so it might, if the parent, whose tyranny dragged the victim to the altar, should repent and had the pow er of claiming his injured child, and taking her again to his bosom.
But this cannot be done; parental authority does not reach this mansion; and if an inhabitant of it should make her escape, to what is slie to trust? how is she to live? or Avhcre is she to go ? When reduced to despair, the asylum she has quitted may receive her again within its gates, but it must be, at best, to suffer a life of torturing penance; while her family and relations w ill execrate her disgrace, and aid her punishment.
Besides, w'ere there no other obstacles to an escape, the lofty walls that enclose 'us, the massive bars that coniine us, and the watchful eyes that guard us, are more than sufficient to damp any spiiit of enteiv
prise
27	"'■l
prise that is not suggested by madness or	j
despair*.
Let me again entreat you to call Reason to yOUr aid: respect my situation, I beseech you, and consider your own. If the few charms which I may possess, and which are every hour fading away, have thus strangely fascinated you, I have another and very unexpected motive to wish that Nature had been a niggard to me: I might then have been unobserved by the monster who drove me hither, and the mortifications of this place would not have been encreased by your fruitless sighs and unavailing endeavours.
Again I exhort you to apply your own understanding and reflection to the subject; do not deceive yourself, but open your eyes upon the impossibility of success. Ifit depended upon me alone, I could not flatter you with a single gleam of hope; but there are a thousand insurmountable obstacles between your wishes
•Alas, Isabella! you are the dupe of your own heart:—it is such an entcrprize that you now meditate.

and my consent, even if it were possible to ob-.	i

■ as to turn your thoughts to the recovery of yours, it is my duty to put an end to this correspondence ; and while I entreat you to extinguish a flame which must burn in vain, I ought to give my counsel the energy it deserves,	i

If you wislied to banish me for ever from you, in what cruel moment was it that you consented t^ admit me once again to your presence? Was it your design to complete your triumph, by rendering my love more intolerable, and hastening my despair ?

The snowy robe, which hangs in ample folds around you, gives a simple, awful, yet winning dignity, which all the luxury of the loom could not afford; and the black, transparent veil, which, while it hides nothing, sets off every thing, and would make an homely countenance interesting,— alas, what is its office when it floats around	'

Isabella, did you think to cure my passion at once, by calling me again to the contemplation of those charms which inspired it?— and do you think them faded?

THE ANSWER.
What fatal influence governs me that I should write to you again?—and wherefore	|
do I suffer your reproaches to reach me?	^
Alas! I deserve them not;—my heart laments	^
your anguish; but it does not accuse me of	i
giving one pang to your bosom. When you call me cruel, you are yourself unjust, very	^
1	unjust indeed, to one who never injured you,
^ who shares your troubles, and would willingly
add to the cruelty of her destiny, if that would	'
avail, to calm them for ever.---Ungrateful	»
man! have I used any arts to seduce you?--	I
Have I not, from the first moment you made	'
known your passion, urged every motive that might prevail on you to forget the unattainable object of it? Did I build these walls?
Was I the architect of my eternal prison ? Did	j
my hands forge the bars beyond which I cannot

34
not pass !—Answer me from your heart, and cease to accuse me.
Hush your passions for a moment, and, in the interval of reason, let me ask you, what would you think of a woman who should break the most solemn vows, risque her honour, and disgrace her -sex, (I speak not of life, for that cannot be called a sacrifice,) to throw herself into the arms of a stranger, without any security for her fame or her hap-	|
piness but the declaration of a passion, which,	-
being kindled in a moment, may, in a moment, be extinguished? You cannot suppose I mean to accuse you of baseness or treachery: this letter proves how free my heart is from such ungenerous suspicions. I doubt not of your present sincerity; but I have a right to consider the fickleness natural to youth. Alas ! the many examples of female wretchedness,
Ibundcd on hasty confidence, 'which even my small information has unfolded to me, will more than justify me.
Is there a situation so horrible^ or can Imagination, in its most gloomy moments,
form
35
form any lot so worthy of pity, and so totally	:j
desperate, as that of a woman in my situa-	t
tion, who, having broken her monastic vows,	^
sliould be deserted by the man who had se-	i
I
duced her ? Banished from her country, not	^ i
only by a sense of shame, but the dread of	*
I	punishment,—without the means of support in
a distant land, whose language she may not know,—what is left for her but to die in a state of wretchedness which makes me shud-	|
;	der in the reflection, or to gain a precarious	5
subsistence, by a life of abandoned prostitution, which is worse than any wretchedness,	I
and only delays, to encrease, the agonies of	i
despair.	’	;
The history of such a dreadful disaster is	*
not the dream of fiction; upon the walls of	I
.	this Cloister such a story is recorded. I have	1
read, day after day, the horrid tale, and have	'
as often wept the fate of an unhappy sister of this Convent, who was thus seduced, and w as thus abandoned ; tvho lived the miserable life, and died the agonizing death, , w hich I	j
have described. Whenever this inscription	|
meets
i
' . A
I
36
meets my eyes, I considei* these walls as an asylum, which, though they do not afford me happiness, will, at least, preserve me innocent; and, though this Monastery may not possess an opiate for discontent, it will secure me from despair. With such impressions as these, and under such circumstances as I now profess, the woman who could be won, at such an hazard, to break her solemn engagements, would not deserve to be united to a worthy man, nor be capable of administering to his happiness :—nay, when the ardour of passion began to subside, a worthy man would startle at her imprudence, and find his affection lessen under the natural suspicion of her future infidelities. Such a woman wouM be unchaste in the contemplation of so bold a design; she would be abandoned before she sought the protection of her seducer. Leave me then, I beseech you;----be grateful to that Providence
which smiles upon you, and turn your heart from an nnfortunate object who cannot offer the returns it so wtU deserves. Bestow, if
you
37
you please, some share of your compassion upon me ; but give your affections to those for	,
whom Heaven designed them.	II
You tell me, Sir, that you have a Mother	i '
who doats upon you: return, then, to comfort the fond parent, who must languish in	'
the absence of such a son as you. Haste, oh	'
haste, to gladden her declining years ! Give	i
the smile of joy to those who long for your return, and to your country that worth which	\
will be an honour to it. The renewal of such	>
glowing affections as you will experience among those to whom Nature has united you,	^
the ardour of those social regards which renewed Friendships will rekindle, and the en-I	trance upon those Duties which your rank	'
must claim, will soon dispel the passion which	j
now torments you, and leave your heart free	!
for the impression of some more worthy object of your own country, of your own religion, and speaking your own language, with whom you will enjoy the fruits of an honest and virtuous passion,	unmingled	with	any re-	i
morse,	and free	from	any reproach.---Then,,	’
^	“‘y	i

I	i
r
38	f!
ray generous friend, you will remember these	|
counsels with regard; and, that youthful, ardent passion which now disturbs your peace, being extinct, you will respect the memory of one who made some sacrifices to suppress it,	,
and thank me, at every moment of reflection, that 1 opposed those desires whose gratification would have caused our mutual undoing.
I have written, in this letter, the language of my heart;—in a dispassionate moment it must be the language of yours. I will consent to receive an answer to this, on the condition that it shall contain a last adieu.—The idea of an eternal farewell from one who has thought so highly of me as you have done, cannot but affect me; and if a sensibility I cannot resist forces the waters upon ray cheek, be assured that Reason will mingle the tears of satisfac^ tion with them.

LETTER XIH.
TO ISABELLA.
If a word of reproach stole into any letter	^
which I have addressed to you, I acknowledge	|f
its injustice, and must search for an excuse in	S
some moment of distraction, when tlie weak-	f
ness of my hopes hurried me into an intempe-	f
rate arraignment of your heart. It deserves an higher praise than T have the power to bestow, and to gain admittance into it is the oh-	t
ject of all my wishes. If I am not found	*
[	worthy to be received into that temple of all	r
good, let not the Divinity, who possesses it,	jj|
exclude me from the sad privilege of passing	; ||
V	the rest of my devoted life before its gates.	|
When I have expired there, every sorrow	|

I	against you. If I could dare to accuse Pro-
vidence, I should say it was unjust in suffering one of its creatures, on whom it had been so	^
lavisli, to be hidden from the eye of the world;	j
^	and that to plant such a flower in a desert,	j
would be to justify the avarice' which makes	i
treasure of no use. But the ways of Heaven, however mysterious, should be respected by weak mortals, and the severest storms of life demand submission instead of reproach. Submission is a necessary duty, and reproach is the worst of crimes: hardened Villany and outrageous Despair are alone capable of committing it.
To be deprived of that which can alone make life valuable, is a circumstance of real misery: to have the only hope blasted on which happiness depends, is the summit of misfortune. Such a situation will be mine, if I do not possess you; but it shall not make me blaspheme against Heaven or you. I cannot command either my feelings or my fate; but I can offer the one as a silent ■	sacrifice to you, and submit with patience,

not a slave to the delusions of love, but to love itself; that ennobling’ and tender sentiment, which gives to the soul a proper sensibility of its own nature, which awakens the finest and most exalted feelings, that raises humanity to something more than human, and is only a better name for the most exalted virtue.
Do not be surprised nor angry when you are informed that I have put an end to a connection which has been nursed with care by those who governed my education; a connection which began with my infancy, and was designed, at a future period, to have been sanctified at the altar.

such a strange, unknown, and powerful sensibility possessed me, that I began to think that my features would partake of the trans-	(I
formation.—I now thought no more of my	' !

forgotten; and ail those ties with which Na-	ifr

upon the offer with disdain, to become the master of a cottage, from whence I could be hold the turrets of your prison. It would be-no small comfort to say.

The pleasure of opening my lattice, to behold the morning sun gild the i ■ spires of your convent, w'ould be far greater	i
I	than the proudest spectacle the world could	I
‘	afford me; and, at the evening hour, to	\
It 1	breathe my sighs beneath the walls that enclose

,	That I am a stranger to you is most true,
and, being so, I cannot wonder at your apprehensions ; but this is my only crime: conscious, however, of my integrity, and knowing what I am, your distrust mortifies and distracts me.

I HAVE obeyed your commands, and I trust	j

been flying from happiness, and am now at a torturing distance from you. As 1 promised submission, however disappointed in the means which you have taken to prove my sincerity,
I cannot complain.—But if you have ordained that I am to see you no more, the measure of	!
my griefs will soon be completed.	^
I have read again and again the paper which	j
was the unexpected warrant of my exile ! a thousand times has my curious attention endeavoured to discover, but in vain, the tender-	^
ness which, you tell me, lurks within it. Is it a sign of your favour, Isabella, to banish me from you, and at once to dissipate the few rays of comfort which are left me ; or, rather, to deprive my fainting spirits of what sustained	. j

them in life, if my present existence can deserve that name ? I was near you, and some-	I
times saw and conversed with you; this was a privilege, the loss whereof cannot find a possible compensation, at the distance to which your commands have driven me. The roof	j
that covered you was a pleasing object to me: I	i
could see the trees which towered above your	J
garden walls, beneath whose shade you some-	I
times reposed ; and to be awakened from my feverish slumbers by the same bell which summoned you to your early duties, was a conso-	i
;	lation which I possess no more.' These were
circumstances of no small importance to one who loves like me. Happiness does not leave its habitation in the human heart, while it has a single point whereon to rest. Though it enjoys but small repose, though it never knows the uninteiTupted interval, still it yields, with reluctance, the little it possesses, and when it is driven from the sanctuary it will cleave to I	the threshold. It strives to attain the whole ;
this is its aim and ambition; and, though all its endeavours may prove unavailing in this
world,

world, it	cannot be driven, but by	the severest	^
stroke of Fate, to quit an habitation which it seems to have been originally designed to oo ' cupy.
I have now taken my abode in she most beautiful city of the universe, and I preferred it as the place of my present exile, from the recollection of those pleasures it had already
afforded me.-----But, alas I my mind is so
changed from what it was when I was here before, that the objects of its former amusement and satisfaction produce nought but weariness and disgust.—I was then—but let that
pass and be forgotten-------such a description

loving you.------Every thing thatis magnificent

the slave of your charms ; and ray heart pants f	but for you. If my dejected spirits were ca-	|
pable of being deluded from their woe, this place not only possesses but offers every means to aid the friendly deception ;—but, amidst	i
them all, I remain the same, and the only object which can engage my attention is the angry Volcano, that is now casting forth its burning entrails, and spreads terror and deso-lation around it. What, can nothing but sights of horror attract my notice, or is it that I also bear a consuming flame within me, and look towards the labouring mountain as an emblem of myself?
The further I fly from you, the more I seem to love you : and, like the bird that is limed, in struggling to be free, I encrease my bondage. If you thought that banishment

frozen seas, or beneath burning suns, he looks	j
f	towards it with a faithful and longing regard,
and would gladly leave the fairest el}^siuras of the earth to return thither.—If you sent me away to lose my importunities, great and in- ' considerate was your cruelty ; for you might have saved me the pain of a feverish journey, by commanding me into silence: I would have obeyed you, though I had sealed my obedience with my death.—If you wished, by your last injunction, to try the extent of your authority over me, I have satisfied you, and expect my reward.
Happiness and Misery are only known by comparison. The bitter anxiety I suffered, when I lived beside your gates, was light as air, when put in the balance against the weight of my present solicitude, now I am such a

to my tomb.
At this moment, I am utterly incapable of	|
expressing the smallest part of those emotions	I

THE ANSWER.
I HAVE already told you, and I am more than sorry that you oblige me to repeat my complaints, of your injustice. You are studious to torment yourself; and,	in tlie rest-	^
lessness of your own griefs, you	lift up your	*
voice against me. Whatever might be ray	\
motives to desire your absence,	it becomes	i
you to suppose them just, both towards yourself and me. The time may not be distant when you will be made acquainted with them; but you must wait with patience for a disclo-

I	Wherefore are your letters filled with de-
j	scriptions of your own misery, with accusa-
I	tions of my cruelty, and the menaces of
I	your own despair ? Can you be so mis-
taken in me, as to suppose that such a me-. I	thod of writing will render them pleasant
and acceptable to n.e Alas! it will make w	me wish never to receive them. You have
every reason to he satisfied with me : I have y	already gone very far, perhaps too far, in
forming this correspondence with you; and in p	assuming tlie power to command you, I have
gone still farther.—I ask you, and let the question reach your heart, for what end could 1 propose a plan for your conduct, if I were 1	not interested in your happiness ?—When I
reflect on the manner I have acted towards j;	you, the language of your last letter fills me
with astonishment: if I know myself, I deserve returns of respect and gratitude, rather t	than those of menace and reproach.
Let

^ 1
Let me entreat you to give somewhat of	]
^	regularity to your sentiments. The sincerity ,	|
of affection is not proved by wild and inco-	I
I	lierent declamation. Pure and solid love is
ever accompanied with reason; and, though	j
its language may glow with more than com-	j
mon animation, though, to common ob-	I
servers, it may appear sometimes to stray	^
i	from its associate, it never quits, in reality,
^	that sober guidance which can alone preserve
it from folly and intemperance. If you iina-gine that the affections of a reasonable woman j ^ are to be gained by an unmanly sensibility,
■	you are shamefully mistaken. We may weep
over the sorrows of those whom we despise, but something more than extorted compassion is necessary to prepare the heart for the impressions of a tender passion. There are no qualities which women so much admire in the other sex as courage and resolution ; even the romantic excesses of them seldom fail to re" ceive their esteem and approbation. The education, the frame, and duties of women, naturally lead them to consider men as theii
guardians
• F-
; 1
} ' 60 ^
I	guardians : to them they look for protection;
^	and the manly virtues, which I have already
\	named, qualify them to answer such proper
^	expectations. When, therefore, they are
■j	deficient in such an essential and honourable
I	part of their character, the weakness even of
v^omen will know how to despise them.
! I	In the language of your last letter, you may
I	reply, that, in all the horrid catalogne of dan-
gers, there is not one which you would not 1	encounter for my sake; nay, that you would
not only risque but sacrifice your life to preserve mine, or make it happy. I am too well disposed to believe you; but true courage is '	something more than this. Cowards have
been known to fight; Passion will have its	S
fits of rashness ; the trembling Miser will de-	jP
fend his treasure, as the weakest animal will,	I
in despair, combat v ith the strongest. But	■
such temporary exertions of Courage do not > I answer to my ideas of a brave and manly cha-	I
'	racter. He must be disposed, in every act of	■
^	his life, to manifest a becoming resolution;	I
! '	and he who passes his days ui the peaceful bo-
som

'5
i
61	I
som of retirement, may find equal occasion to exert it, with him whose lot is cast in tlie ao	'
tivity of camps and the turmoil of war. There is a certain dignity of character which the brave man will never lose, whether he resists the terrors of the tented field, or the temptations of luxurious life ; whether he fights with the armed enemy, or with himself, the most dangerous of all enemies. In vain will the warrior turn the attention of a wise man to the acclamations of his soldiers, if he dis_	r-
graces his public triumphs by sinking beneath private misfortunes. The bravery of battle is often mechanical; the fear of disgrace, the apprehension of punishment, the spirit of emulation, even the power of sympathy, may make a man brave lor the occasion. But the true principle of Courage supports the character whom it inspires, at all times and on all occasions. The mind of that man is above fear, and it is not in the power of human events to make him shrink from his purpose.
Insensibility is a very different quality.
The brave man feels, but it is not in a manner G	unworthy
s
!
62	i
unworthy of him. He is capable not only of every great but every tender sentiment. He can love with a real ardour, but which never betrays him into weakness or folly. He calls	j
forth the admiration of her wdio inspired his passion, and insures her regard by the dignity ,	of it. Whenhis bosom heaves with the pangs of
doubt and suspense, he exhibits an example of that noble suffering w hich it is the honour and privilege of Beauty to relieve. He does not ',	win his way to the heart by those delusions to
which so many weak, unhappy women ow e their ruin, but by that affecting demeanour, those kind attentions, generous and maniy confidence, which secure the most exalted sentiments of female nature to plead his )	cause.
This is the character which I would hold f	up for you to imitation: embrace it, I beseech
you, and cease to disgrace yourself by com-	jj
plaint and tears. How often have you threatened to put an end to your life in my presence ? fn what affecting language do you call my attention to the grave, where your agitated
fra me
>
i
frame is to sleep in peace, and to find refuge	^
from my cruelties (—Gracious Heaven !—and	f
is it possible you can think me cruel!—	1
That such ideas as these do not affect me,	^
I have not declared ;—they really go much	<
farther, tliey terrify and alarm me ;—they dis-	1
tract tliat tenderness you wish to inspire, and	A
disturb that sympathising pity which a sincere	C
passion will not fail, in some degree, to awa-	■j
ken in a feeling bosom. I know, my friend,	W
as well as you, what Despair can meditate;	*
but it is unworthy of you, and hitherto you	^
have no reason to despair.
To excite compassion is considered as age-	I
iieral and easy method to gain the female	|
heart! and it may sometimes effect tlie pur-pose in the ordinary and uninterrupted inter-	,
course of life. But it must be something more than pity;—the noblest and most exalted sentiments can alone urge a woman to risque	\
what such a prisoner as I am must hazard to obtain my freedom. Do you think that I should contrive an escape from these walls for no other purpose but to hush a sigh, or wipe g2	away
V
64
away a tear ? No, my friend, you must first
teach me to esteem, to admire, to worship
you ; and to form and partake the happiness
of the being one adores would make every - j
hazard contemptible, and justify the utmost
effort of human resolution.
Read this letter with attention ; yield to its suggestions ; rouze yourself from that heaviness of soul which at once distresses and dis-.	honours you. Love, pure, generous, distin-
terested love, elevates the human character.
Convince me that you glow with such a passion by those proofs which may destroy every	.
suspicion. If I did not think you capable of	j
it, thisletter would never have been written.—
I do not wish to deal in vaunting language;	i
but these sentiments do not disgrace me: and,
O	'	I
if you are at all skilled in the human heart, I need not tell you, that she who possesses them will not be checked, by any obstacle on earth, from endeavouring, at least, to become the blessing of superior virtue. Adieu !	'	'

‘	It cannot be more ardent or'sincere, but I am,

'	an higher lustre, by fortifying my despondent
, I	mind with the instructions of Wisdom, and
communicating the rays of Hope to dispel the clouds that had surrounded me. I begin to discern a possibility of happiness, which has enlivened me into a capacity for some of the enjoyments of life. My heart does not now ‘	sicken at the thoughts of society, and I have*
ventured upon the serene participation of social *	satisfaction: nay, I now attend to the thunders
of tise neighbouring mountain', "and behold its flaming emptions with some degree of appre-	|

that

I	that there is something which may make life
I	desirable.
I	I only waited to hear from you to make a
voyage to some of the islands of the Mediterranean. Such a design, I must own, was I	formed with the wish that I might never re-
turn; and, now without any real cause for apprehension, I tremble at the hazard of it.— j	AVhat a strange compound is this frail being
j	of ours! tlie sport of every passion, the slave
i	of every opinion; governed not only by the
!	events of life, but subject to the air we breathe,
and tiie climate beneath which we live: some-j	times elevated, as it were, above our nature,
and sometimes depressed into an imbecility which is as far beneath it: now inflamed with |j	rage, and now trembling with fear: alternately
t	the object of praise and condemnation, of envy
and of pity, of admiration and contempt. In this fever of life, I feel an equal danger from the burning as from the chilling fits; and if you do not apply the effectual balm to my >	heart, which you alone possess, my frame
will, at length, sink beneath the conflict, and
you
I
68 '
you will lose the blessed privilege of making '*	him who loves you happy.
f	That I may never see you again is a most
bitter reflection; and when I turn mine eyes i	from the paper, and look upon the vessel that	j
{	waits to bear me still farther from you, I heave
1^.	a sigh that would burst any bosom but mine.—
I	But since I am banished from your presence,
it matters little where I go : your image will ^	accompany me in the blooming vale or in the
sandy desert; on the mountain’s height, or on the bosom of the wave. It will not leave me for a moment, and I shall, at least, have the consolation that it will attend me till I possess the reality, or till I am no more.—I shall be returned before I can receive an answer from you. The gale is favourable; the canvass is unfurled; and the moment I have written this adieu, we shall set sail and be gone.—Why should the tears start from mine eyes as I approach the last line ? Why should my heart sink and grow cold in my breast with the apprehension that it may be an adieu for	<v*
ever ?

I MORE than wish that tliis letter may find you arrived in a state of much impatience, and disposed to reproach me. My heart sympathises with you; and the groundless but cruel fears which chill your bosom have the same effect upon mine, and will continue to agitate it till you announce your safe return. The sea is a faithless element, and danger never	5
ceases to attend the voyager who trusts it.
Every wind that has rattled round our turrets,
I	or whistled through these cloisters, has made
me tremble for you. Shut out from almost	^
every object of Nature but the sky, I watch 1	the floating clouds, and, when they collect
themselves into a tempest, I think of you, and ^ • yield to those melancholy forebodings, which, in spite of every eflbrt of my reason, so cruelly torment me. When the day is serene, I feel
some
i
T
70
some pleasure in the hopes that you may partake of its serenity; but when the tempest rages,* my hostile imagination supposes it to be hastening your destruction, or already to have destroyed you. Reason, or at least, a	|
reason so changed as mine, cannot combat these empty delusions ; and, as if there aVus not enough of reality to make me miserable, these shadowy fancies aid the melancholy Ibrce of my distress.
I am now convinced of your fidelity: the truth of your passion is not better known to your own breast than it is to mine; and my heart reproaches me every moment for having ^ put it to those trials wlsich may be fatal to us both. The hopes with which my last letter must have inspired you, should have averted a project so pregnant with uneasiness: you take	|
a resolution in despair, and put it in practice	■
at the moment when that despair is banished. .	I
If my fancy, busy as it is in torturing me, could have supposed so strange a Bight, I	^

able purpose, when you must perceive that	>
they were hastening, alas ! too last, to meet	,
your wishes ? The very apprehensions that troubled you at your departure were w arnings	|
that you should not go, and should have been obeyed,
y ou tell me of your impatience for the period of your return : alas! when once you I	have consigned yourself to the sea, all power	J
is taken from you. You arc the slave of the discordant elements which reign there, and you must yield to their capricious direction.
Tliey may turn you from your course, and	|
the impatient vessel which contains you will	,■

faint appeal to me be opposed by the angry wave.
So impatient am I to hear from you, that I had not thrice read your letter, when I hastened to answer it, at a time also, and with a want of precaution, which might undo me.
But I cannot resist the impulse of my heart, which will not cease to suffer a fluctuating misery till your own hand has informed me of your safety,

I HAVE waited several days beyond the time I might have expected to hear from you, with a most cruel impatience; and I trust, that, before this reaches Naples, some tidings of your safe arrival there will put an end to it.
I now accuse myself with all the bitterness of reproach, for having driven you so far away. I feel it as an act of injustice, and
veugeance
i

i	vengeance bas overtaken me. The pains	i
which you have described with so much	j
energy reign in my breast. Other fears have,	^
ef late, alarmed me; but they are passed.	|	i
A very particular attention of late from the	■,
Reverend Mother awakened suspicions that . our correspondence was discovered, and that	i
the letter which I have so anxiously expected	,	'
was fallen into her hands. That trouble,	|
thank Heaven! is over; a trouble which i	arose from my own trembling conscience.	j
'	So far from being the object of any unfavour-
able conjectures, I am appointed, by her pre-*	ference, to an office of great confidence in	•
the Convent; which I willingly accepted, for	^
;;	reasons which she does not suspect, and you	|
j	will approve.—Alas ! how are those around
me deceived! My conduct is the admiration of the old, and the example of the young;	V
while I pity the ignorance of them all, and	,	!
inwardly glory in the hypocrisy which de-	;
ceives them. It is true, I am devout; but	■
the object of my devotion is far, far difierent from theirs. 1 am an idolater as well as they;
!	ri	but

but my heart worships another idol. When their hymns ascend the skies, mine soars not above the eartli: their prayers are for an heavenly recompence; mine only aspires to mortal happiness. When it is my office to make the organ aid the vocal choir, unseen I chant a less holy song; and when celestial favour is supposed to give my fingers their cunning, a being of this world is in my heart, and inspires me.
Sometimes I envy my sisterhood their happy ignorance, and wish that my bosom	!
possessed it. The busy world is nothing to them; they know none of	its cares and trou-	I
bles, are not perplexed by	its doubts and un-	I
certainties, nor will ever be racked by its dis-	)
appointments. They have already been for ever at rest in its tumultuous bed, gained the i j	harbour of peace, 'without	being bulleted by
I	those billows by which the	inhabitants of the
world must be tossed before they can attain it.
;	Why was instruction given to enlighten my
mind, and open the avenues of sorrow'?—
While my happy sisters look upon the walls I	which
' 11
1	r
^	which surround them as barriers placed by the	1
kindness of Heaven against the dangers and	|	*
delusions of a wicked world ; my eyes would	I	;
pierce them, and my heart execrates every	I	(
obstacle which bars the sight of you—they	|	'
would fain throw their anxious glances to the	]
sea whereon late you sailed; where, perhaps, you may, at this time, be guiding your im-	,j <
patient vessel; where, alas ! you may be	t
stemming the menace of an outrageous tide;	I
where, oh heavens! you may be freed from	, ,
all the troubles of a tumultuous life. Every	?
hour brings these sad presages with it; haste	'
then to banish them for ever.

f:
Isabella, I have escaped from slavery	I
still to be a slave ! The irons with which my	,
barbarian masters fettered me, are shook off;	|
but I have not found freedom. A bondage more lasting than that trom which I have	t
been delivered, still holds me fast; and she	;
alone, who has enslaved my heart, can give me perfect liberty. Perhaps , the dangers I have passed, and the misery I have suffered,	■:
since she heard of me, will soften her obdu-	|

Barbary corsair pursued our ship, which was,	i
unfortunately for us, a Spaniard,—attacked it,	b
and, after a manly resistance on our part, we	j
were forced to submit; a resistance which cost us dear, as it heightened the cruelty which	I
those monsters, for I shall not call them men,	w
who proved our conquerors, exercised over > P us. My friends, myself, and all the crew,	j
were loaded with chains, and thrown without	|
distinction into the bottom of the vessel,	i
where we were so closely confined, breathed	l
such putrid air, and were fed with such scanty	j
and miserable provisions, that several of my	;1
unhappy fellow-prisoners died, and nothing	[f
could have preserved me from the same	j;
wretched fate but the remembrance and hopes	1
of you. Love darted its vivifying rays into	j
my dark and dismal abode; your form was never absent from me; and in the temporary deliriums of despair, wdiich sometimes seized me, my rage, as I have since been told, did not hinder me from pronouncing your name with a melting excess of tenderness. On the ^ -	fourth day,—for we had been frequently becalmed	j
79	I
calmed since our capture,—our stern masters,	I
finding that death made such an havock among	, m
their prey, suffered us, from time to time, to	) I
breathe tlie fresh air, and to see the light of	r
the sun. The weastier, however, becoming	^
favourable, we soon arrived at Algiers, and were immediately thrown into a dungeon,	'
where Hope entirely forsook me, and I ex-	|
pected, nay wished, every moment to pour	I
forth my last sigh to you. I did not, however,	"
remain long in this miserable situation: by the active zeal of the British Consul, my liberty was soon restored to me, and my de-,l	spairing bosom yielded to the delicious hopes
‘	of seeing you once again. I seized the oppor-
tunity of a ship that was setting sail for Marseilles, to quit the barbarous shore: after a	^
short voyage I am safe arrived, but so feeble	?
and emaciated, that your penetrating eye would not be able to distinguish the features you knew so well. It was my determined purpose to return instantly to you; but the weak state in which I found myself, and the remonstrances of my physician, who assured
me
w-------------------------------------------------------------^
80
me I should not survive such a journey, even if I should be able to complete it, has arrested my design. Nothing but the apprehensions	j
of certain death, my Isabella ! could have hin-V dered me from hastening to present myself at your gate. I must content myself, therefore,	'
at this moment, with writing to you; and though I already find myself better, it belonged only to such a passion as mine, which gives a temporary strength to nature, and makes it capable of efforts beyond its ordinary powers, to inspire me with force to write this imperfect letter. May I trust that it will meet with a tender reception from you? that you will pity my distresses, and give me the blessed assurance that you will soon relieve them ? In vain shall I have escaped the dangers of the sea; in vain shall I have survived the cruelty	'
of barbarians ; in vain will favouring Heaven restore me to health and strength, if you do	i
not complete she work, and assure me that you will be mine.
A Neapolitan vessel, which is on the moment of departure from this port, bears my
orders

orders to forward any letters, that may be now	I
j	expecting me at Naples, to this jdace. I flatter myself that some of them will give me	(

that a life almost miraculously preserved, is	<
i	destined to be happy. If I had no other evil	1
to combat, my impatience would prove a dis-	|

all, my sufferings should quicken stie progress	!

V	THE ANSWER.
My heart is surprized with Comfort, at the moment when I have taken Misery for its long and last companion. I had lost all expectation of ever hearing from you again :—it was my firm and sad belief that you were gone where I could be remembered no more. Your resurrection

* At this silent hour, when the inhabitants	j
of these walls are at rest, I enjoy an happiness	;
which they can never know. I gild the mid-	I

it, and offers up its watchful hours to the, ob-	I
ject of it.—Having yielded to this effusion of tenderness, which I could not resist, it be-	j
comes me now to assume another tone. This letter, my friend, demands your most serious ^	attention. The language of Passion, and ex-	I
pressions of Regard, must submit, at this time, to the sober dictates of calm Reason. The bold and uncommon enterprize I am about to i ^	undertake, re([uires that this sage oracle should	|
be consulted. It is necessary, before I take the measure for which I am preparing, that tliere should be a clear intelligence between us. It is a duty incumbent on myselsi it is a duty I owe to you, to enter into some consideration of our respective situations, as they relate to ourselves and to each other. Do not imagine, however, that, by this serious intrc-duction, I mean to retract my engagement with you ;—do not be alarmed with the apprehensions that I wish to check those desires which I liave myself encouraged;—on the contrary, you are about to receive the best proof I can give that they will be gratified.
But

p.
But it is necessary to be explicit in a matter of	^
such importance to us both; and I beg of you	f I
not to he offended by my declaration, that no-	^ j
thing less than a solemn public Marriage will	/j .i
satisfy me.	|/
I know very well how critical my situation	4
will be when I have escaped from this Clois-ter, and, which must be the immediate con-	JJ
sequence, have taken my flight to another	^
country. I am equally sensible how depen-	V
dent I must be upon your honour and justice,	-
when I have deprived myself of every other protection : but be assured, though you pos-	J
sessed a degree of perfection never yet known	f
to mortals, heightened by all stiat wealth and	f
power could give you, I would rather pass	I
my days in the darkness and despair of a dun-	1
geon, than associate myself with you in any	1
other character than that of your Wife. Do	i
not, therefore deceive yourself or me. 'Think	I
not that an intemperate advantage may be	|
taken of an ardent aftection, and a friendless state, to force me to wear any other character.	|
The means of life are,, some way or other,
I	ever
p. ■
86
ever open to youth and industry; and those arts which I have been taught as the accom- • plishments of my rank and sex, will not I'ail to give me the bread of Virtue; and, if the lowest servitude were necessary to attain it, I would joyfully embrace the rude employment to be preserved from Infamy.—But from such a necessity Friendship has already secured me.
A w Oman, however weak she may be by	B
the general rule of Nature, will sometimes rise to strength which manhood cannot equal; and she, who will encounter the danger and	’
fatigue which I have determined to meet for your sake, is equal to the proof of such declarations as I have now oflered to \ou.—But ^ • •
this is not all. The mere forms of marriage	j
^	will not content me; it must be solemnized,	^
not only in the face of the world, but in the presence of your mother, and all those relations who are interested in your happiness.
It is from them, and from them alone, that we must receive each other at the altar. My I	only hopes of real comfort in this world de-

upon my being qualified to compleat yours,	■
I will not, in spite of my affections, yield to	I
it, if it should be menaced with the unpro-	, I
pitious omen of parental disapprobation. Your	J
reason cannot but approve these sentiments,	fl
which are so irrevocable in my breast, that	m
should you venture to combat them, my re-	■
solution is taken to hear from you no more,	1
and to resign myself, without furtlier hopes,	I
to my present allotment. The mere wish to	|
gratify a violent passion is one thing; the de-	|
sire of solid happiness is another: the former	i
has no consideration but itself; and, for a short-lived pleasure, makes a willing but fatal sacrifice of every real comfort and honour of life: the latter, being created by a passion which partakes of, and is, indeed, governed by sentiments of virtue, must be accompanied	*
with the prospect of durable satisfaction. You I	are a young man of no common expectations,
possessed of great wealth, and the object of . a most tender attention, not only from an	1
anxious parent, but from numerous and ho-	|

\	nourable friends. Their wishes for your prosi
\	perity must look to a wise and suitable raar-
^	riage: tliis, indeed, from your own account,
was the object of their first thoughts; and you were brought up from your infancy with I ■	the idea of a particular matrimonial connec-
tion. On the contrary, I am the native of a country distant from yours, without fortune, without friends, and have bound myself by '	the most solemn vows to a religious life and
eternal celibacy. You must suppose me, also, to have broken those vows, which, as far as ' ^	they relate to me, must be regarded as sacred
engagements, even by those whose mode of faith declares them to be contrary to the prin-ciples of reason and justice. In this situation,
^	and under these particular circumstances, what-^
ever jsity might accompany the idea of me in f	benevolent minds, I should be generally con-
'	sidered with little favour: very harsh opinions
may be given upon my subject; and it would not, I fear, be an easy matter to reconcile	I
your marriage with me as prudent and honour-	i
'	able on your part. Gracious Heaven! my	I
[	intentions	I
r	V'
89
intentions may be misrepresented, and, per-	^
haps, my very virtue suspected. At all events I shall have much—much disadvantage to encounter ; especially as I have been the cause, though the innocent cause, of turning you from that connection which has been the object and wish of your nearest friends and rela-	*
tions. Who will believe the honours of my birth? or, if that circumstance should meet with the credit it deserves, will it not be said that my conduct has degraded me ? General prepossessions will be against me: this I must ‘ • expect, and could be willing for some time to bear, because I know the purity of my heart, and that they might be worn away by an ex-	.	I
emplary discharge of domestic duties. The. jussice of mankind might, in time, be favourable to me ; and I do not imagine that cruel suspicion would long continue to harass me in the character of a fond, affectionate, and faithful wife. If I was so happy as to receive the approbation of your family, I should soon,
I trust, be favoured with that of the world.
Such are my sentiments and principles;—
I'	I 3	I repeat

[	I repeat again that they are unchangeable, and
-	that I shall be governed by them alone in the
'	important event which is hanging over me.
Be assured that I am unshaken ; and if you i	feel any repugnance to them in your own
breast, if you know, or even suspect, any op-^	position to them from your own circum-
I	stances and connections, I rely upon your
honour, in which I have the greatest confidence,—I trust to your heart, which, I firmly *	believe, cannot be led astray from it,—to be
^	explicit with me and to hide nothing from me
in a matter of so much importance to us both.
In deceiving me, if it were possible, you will :	sadly deceive yourself; and in compleating
my dishonour, you will, most assuredly, pro-'	mote your own. The very idea of separating
'	' you from your family terrifies me; nor would
r	I purchase the happiness of being yours at
^	such a price.
I shall now proceed to tell you, that the '	'	plan of my escape is so well formed as not to
admit of a doubt of its success ; but there are	U
conditions to be fulfilled on your part, pre-	8

I have seen my mother and received her blessing'; I have embraced my friends and been melted with their kindness; and, though many objections arose on my imparting the design I had formed with respect to yourself, they were soon silenced; the picture I drew of you, and the desire of seeing me happy, won their commands to tell you, and I obey them wissi rapture, that they' will receive the fair stranger I shall present to them with a pleasure equal to my own. You may now, therefore, hasten to put your escape in execution; and I have nothing to wish, but that your success in coinpleating it,	I

may be equal to the forid affection which is impatient to crown it. During this important interval, I shall be in a state of suspense the most painful thatcanbe conceived, from which I trust and entreat you will not delay a moment to relieve me.
If it were possible for my idolati7 of you to admit of an higher enthusiasm, your last letter would have exalted those sentiments with which your charms and excellence had already inspired me; but my heart has long attained its height of love and admiration. I cannot but approve your wisdom, liowever unnecessary it may be for you to exert it in framing precautions with respect to me. I am, as I ever will remain, faithful to your affections, and the guardian of your honour. I shall add new lustre to the virtues of my family by adding you to it; and, when they shall see and know you, their present prepossessions will grow into the tenderest regard and affection for you.—Wherefore is the hour

object it ever beheld ? Why have I not received your commands to meet you on your way, to conduct you hither? Oh, Isabella! w’liy is the solid joy you promise me to be so slow in its completion; and the apprehensions of danger and fatigue, which may distress you in your tedious journey, to have such a space for tormenting me? Command me, I beseech you, to where you shall take your first repose from the hazard of your flight. Who can be so qualified to welcome you to liberty as the happy lover, the office of whose life w ill be to make it a blessing to you? Who can so well sooth your fears, and calm your agitated spirits, as he whose duty, whose honour, whose supreme happiness it will be, to protect you from every evil throughout your days ? You will be unjust both to me and to yourself, if you refuse me this ardent request, and prevent the Lover from giving a proof of what he will be, when he is exalted into the. happy character of an husband. It is absolutely necessary that you should have some	|
person to protect you during your journey: a	II

female companion cannot be sufficient; and if any other should attend you, I shall he jealous of his charge, and think he robs me of what is now my claim, and mine alone. Think on this I entreat you; and do not let a false delicacy subject you to inconveniencies and dangers the very thoughts of which make me tremble.
In the interval of hearing again from you, it will be my happy employment to prepare every comfort and elegance for yourreception, in this land of freedom, which love can command and wealth can purchase. Blessed, truly blessed in the possession of so much excellence, and rich beyond expression in the treasure which I shall have brought from a foreign country to adorn my own, I shall see, with pride, the envy that will wait upon your superior charms, and watch, with pleasure, the rapid decay of that malevolent passion before your superior virtues. Oh, Isabella! is it possible that I should be so happy as to call j you mine? I know not how to think that Heaven wall so completely bless me.:—my i pa§t life cannot merit pre-eminent delight; it '	must

must therefore be the duty of my future days to deserve the blessing.
I again implore you to let me meet you on your way; and in the hope of your compliance with this intreaty, I shall be continually prepared for an instant departure. A painlul impatience will tyrannize over me till I receive tliat command which will speed my flight to you.—Adieu 1 May Heaven protect my darling Isabella!—At this moment, surely, I may call her mine.

I BLESS Heaven, my friend, for having favoured my escape, and conducted me to a place of safety. My resolution was unshaken; it served me well in the moment of trial, and 1 the friends in whom I trusted have proved	IH

. into that degree of strength wdiich was necessary for my flight. So long shut out from objects of nature and the world, my alarms were unceasing, and in every being I met, my fears beheld a pursuer. Tlie torrent that roared, andthepinethatwhispered, as I passed the mountains, filled me with equal terror; and I suffered an agony during my rapid journey which will demand some days of repose to overcome. One of the companions of my flight is the female friend who has been so faithful to us both, and to whom I had entrusted the wreck of that fortune which the hand of the stranger and the rapacity of religion had taken from me.—Her fidelity must '	be rewarded by every exertion of our friend-
ship throughout life. The other was the sexton of the convent, by whose means I obtained an easy and unsuspected passage from it.—It would have been the most horrible ingratitude to have left him behind to all the rage of religious fury, and, amid the cruel ti esof severe ,	punishment to fling his curses after me. The
remains of his life, already far spent, it is our duty to cherish with every comfort and con* K

der, respectful duty, which such a dear rela-	,

cease to offer to him, nor will you be unpre-	'
pared to follow an example which your heart must so well approve.
H owever ardently I may wish, my d ear friend, to satisfy you in every thing, I cannot, consistent with the principles wliich now direct my conduct, yield a consent to your meeting	)

and ceremony the approach of that happiness which awaits me. But I feel the absolute necessity of giving every mark of decency and good sense that the nature of my conduct will bear. It is my duty to give something of character to a proceeding which, as tli6 world	,

I thank you from my heart, for all the	, I ■.
zeal which you express for my happiness, and feel a most flattering satisfaction at the plea-	|
sure you manifest in making preparations for	!,
my reception; but nothing will afford me so much delight on my arrival in London as to find your mother there to receive me, and hear from her lips the welcome assurance that	^ ^
she will soon be mine. Without this circumstance, the pleasure even of seeing you will have its interruption, and I shall be dissatisfied.
Do not be displeased at my recurring so often to this object of my ambition; if you know any thing of the human heart, it will appear to you in its true light, as the most incontestible proof of my perfect attachment to you.—How must that woman love, who, born to a rank wdiich no one can despise, conscious of her	|
innocence, and enamoured of virtue, should	|
submit to a situation which may make the	*
purity of her intentions suspected! You wist tell me, my dear friend, that 1 ought not to. suffer the doubt of a moment to overshadow Hiy peace: but such is the trembling state of V, .	my

TO ISABELLA.	|
London.	f j
How I envy, my dearest Isabella, the bearer of this paper ! He will see and converse with ^ you long before it will be my happy fortune.
I repine at your commands, but I obey them.
You are the mistress of my present as welt as future fate; and from you will the rest of my days receive their every shade of happiness, from the gentlest glow of common	reciproca-	i
tion to the highest flight of human bliss.	j
The gentleman who will have the honour	I
to present this letter to you, is a person in	;i
whom you may confide; he is your country-man, and has long professed with credit, the	I'U
business of teaching the modern	European	H
languages in this kingdom. He will have tli»

happiness to instruct you in that to which you are to be naturalized. If the winds therefore should prove unfavourable, or you should	i
think a few days repose necessary before you pass the sea, you may amuse yourself with beginning your lessons where I trust and hope you now are. I have ordered him, the moment you arrive in England, to send a courier	i
forward to inform me of the happy tidings,	j
that I may be ready to receive and welcome	i
you to freedom, to love, and to* me. This event is the siibject of all my thoughts ; it accompanies me through the day, and I only sleep to dream of it.
I have never seen you but in the uncomely dress of your religious state; how then will my heart be enraptured when 1 see my pensive nun transformed into a woman of the world, and possessing every power of displayr ing those graces to the utmost advantage, which were divine under every disadvantage of dress, and when seen through a grated window. I know not how I shall bear the gight; tlie very idea throw^s » thiilliug pleasure

sure through my heart that almost insup-	^,
portable. Yet a little while, and this dream shall be realized, and I shall be most blessed.	<
Speed on, ye sluggish hours! and bring the	!
golden moment with you. Blow, ye favour-	^ “j
able gales! and waft her smoothly o’er the main. May no danger overtake or trouble her with the least alarm! and may she arrive	g
soon and safe on that happy shore where	if
Love waits to receive her, and make her happy witli all it can bestow.	i
The friends you bring with you shall be	V
mine; they will have no reason to complain	*
of my ingratitude. I owe them every thing,	|
for they will give me every thing my heart	| i
desires; they will give me you. They shall share my regard and my fortune; and I trust	t.
there will not be a moment of their future lives when repentance will accompany a	! (
thought of their friendship to us. When you	j I
shall repeat to them the assurances of your grateful kindness, let mine attend and confirm	; ]
them.

Let your mind be at rest, I beseech you.
How is it possible for us to doubt of our mu-tual love! We are in this world for no other purpose but to enjoy it. Delicious source of my existence 1 I should not have possessed the heart I have, but to be full of your idea; nor would you have possessed such a soul, if it was not to love me: and it is only to love you as long- as you are lovely, and to receive the return of my passion as long as you are beloved, that Heaven has made us so capable of loving each other.
This letter will be, perhaps, the last I shall ever write to you, as I hope never to sustain so long an absence from you as to make such a messenger of my heart necessary; nevertheless,
I cannot lengthen it, as I am jealous of every moment that separates me from you, and the bearer of it waits but for my conclusion to speed it towards you. Adieu, my dearest Isabella!—but'it shall be the last time I will ever offer such a farewell to you, till Fate commands, and I must bid adieu for ever!

^	LETTER XXVII.	I
TO MR. CROLI.	^
London*
I «1SE from my pillow, which you have	! I
covered with the sharpest thorns, to write	S
this letter: and, if it should arrive before you	j
have quitted yours, you may begin to find it	"
uneasy to you. It is time that I should have	||
some decisive proof of your honourable in-	-jffl
tensions towards me. My mind has of lat®	bH
found great reason to be alarmed concerning *	‘Ij
my situation. I have been in this city several weeks, and have never seen or heard from	^
your mother or any of your relations. Your early excuses were received by me without	im
suspicion; the tenderness of my regard was	^
willing to believe them, and the novelty, as well as variety of gay and magnificent scenes	^
*"	I
I
loe
to which I have been so carefully conducted; served to dissipate my attention; but I am at	_ ^
length awakened from the delirium in which
a strange infatuatioil hadso long kept me.--
To my infinite agony and astonishment, I have been informed by indubitable circumstances, that, in the world, I bear the title of your mistress. I sent immediately to you, to obtain some serious conversation with yOu on a matter of such importance to me, but you were not to be found. Unable to sleeps though blessed with a composure of spirits that astonishes me, I shall pass the remainder of the night in calling to your recollection the vows that you made, and the situation into which a confidence in their truth has led me.
My eyes are now opened to a variety of circumstances which I had not before observed: alas! they all confirm my fears, and give a clear but sad prospect of ray deplorable situation.
In all my conversations with you, since my arrival in England, you seemed to possess a diffidence, which, at the time, I approved, as
appearing	I
I
107
appearing to proceecl from respectful affection,'
^	and that delicacy which might be expected	I
from such a mind as I have hitherto conceived	.
yours to be; but I now suspect it to have been	(
no more than the endeavour to conceal a dis-	j
tress, arising from some secret wish, or some hidden design, that you have not dared to avow. Xhese apprehensions are confirmed	,
by the conduct of that person, who, on your particular recommendation, has been so conr I	' tiiiually with me. His assiduous attentions,
I	obliging manners, apparent attachment to
you; your declaration of his integrity, and my passing the greatest part of every day wdth him, from an eager desire to be instructed in your language; made me respect him so far as to repose no small degree of confidence in him,—a confidence, of which I now perceive he has availed himself, to offer to me, from • time to time, a loose system of morality, which I did not rightly understand, and of	^
which I did not at once see or suspect the ob-ject. For some days past he has grown more jijokl in his opinions: and stie discovery I have
niade
I
i
f
108
made has opened my eyes also to his conduct, which 1 now consider as a preface to some	^
dishonourable proposal from you, of which he was to be the messenger. He will be ad-mitted to me no more; and I desire to see you without delay, that my fears may be entirely	'
removed, or fully confirmed.
If your mother is in that infirm state of health which you have represented as an excuse for her delaying to come to me, there has been no reason assigned why I should not pay my visit of respect to her. I am in health,	■
and would travel barefooted to her, with plea-	,
sure, wherever she may be : a pilgrimage to her bedside would be delightful to me, as I	'
might then, by every act of kind attention,	1
anticipate the duties of a daughter. But, alas! the history of her illness is a mere invention to deceive me;—and is it possible that you can have planned that and many other deceptions which have been contrived to undo me!	[
I am disposed to belie; o that you have loved	1
me; at least, it is at present my interest to encourage such a belief: perhaps you may

There is a dignity in the distress of virtue which elevates the heart against all its oppres?-sions; that dignity is mine, and dictates a language which 1 little thought it would be my -lot to address to you. I command your immediate declaration of your future intentions . concerning me. In telling you of my fears and suspicions I do not accuse you; and by removing them for ever you may assert your hmocence; but, in my present situation, patience will have but a short existence; a single evasion, or a proposition	of delay, on your	|
part, will at once confirm	my fears	and deter-	I
mine my conduct. My tongue has not been	I
accustomed to reproach,	and my	soul soars	»
above the malice of revenge. If you can shield ' yourself from the accusations of your own heart, it will be well for you; for you have nothing to fear frpm mine.

TO ISABELLA.	‘ I
I AM in a state of agonizing confusion	g
which is not to be expressed.---Believe me,
Isabella! my love for you is of the tenderest	|
nature, and I would sacrifice every thing to	|
make you happy. But, alas 1 I cannot sane-	.
tify our union with that consent which you unfortunately consider as essential to it. My	i
heart is and ever will be yours; my fortune is	I
at your command; but I cannot soften the flinty obstinacy of their breasts, who remain
inflexible to my wishes.----I have deceived	y

of your character, than in any ceremony which man may have invented from motives of interest instead of love. My fortune can	j
surround you with a splendor which will attract the envy and admiration of the first people in stiis kingdom; and, if you will accept it, you may leave them as far behind in figure and enjoyment, as you do in beauty and understanding. Nor can I make so happy an use of the wealth which Heaven has so profusely scattered around me, as to purchase every gratificasion you can desire: nay, I will put it out of my power to revoke such a completion of *my wishes, by making a legal settlement upon you, which shall afford you a noble provision, and certain independence of myself and every one.

of tender passion!------Such, I trust, will yet
unite us to each other; and that those ill-founded scruples which proceed from the infectious

soon be removed by the purifying air of the	1
world.—I most inviolably promise to be faith-	1

least share in my affections ; and that, as you	^ !
are the sovereign mistress of them at this moment, you shall continue to command	1
them to the last hour of my existence.— —Do not shudder, my Isabella! at the life of love	*
which awaits you: hasten to enjoy it; and make him, whom you have supremely honoured with your affections, the happiest and most blessed of human beings.—The virtue of love is fidelity; and may every anguish that	I
can torture human nature overtake me when I prove unfaithful to you !
Some affairs of very great importance call me immediately into the country. I go, indeed, with a mind ill-calculated for the arrangements which are foreign to those of the heart; but I live in hopes, that, ere my return, the amiable but romantic enthusiasm, which now	.
possesses you, will have yielded to the resolution of being as happy as wealth and love L st	can

LETTER XXIX.
TO MRS. CROLI. t '	1
This letter. Madam, which is written by one who is a stranger to you, may occasion your surprize, as I believe it Avill awaken your sensibility. There was a time, indeed, when I flattered, vainly flattered myself, that I should have addressed you in another character, and that, in your face, I should have seen the lineaments of a mother. But this, with many other pleasing expectations, is vanished for ever; and a life, which once promised a splendid happiness, must be past in the gloom of dis^content and sorrow.
Bona	I

(l
115	.
Born of one of the first families in Tuscany,	1
I had the misfortune to lose my parents at a	’ 1
time when the ardent wishes of their hearts began to be answered in me, and the labour	J
of assiduous education was not without pro-	V
mise of reward. A brother, who would in	ii
some degree have supplied their place, soon	J i
followed them to the tomb ; and I was left to	||
the sole care of an aged relation, who loved	v
me with real tenderness, and pursued the plan	^1
of instruction which my father had begun.	|
At the end of three years, she was also snatched suddenly from me, when, to avoid the horrors of an odious marriage, and to gain an asylum from the threats of a rapacious but	g!
powerful kindred, who claimed my inherit-	>S
ance, I entered into a convent, and, in the due course of time, took those vows which	,
w ere to separate me for ever from the world.—	*
There I remained struggling whth discontent,	! | j
and endeavouring to find a cure for my sor-	• 11
rows in the offices of religious	duty. My	^|l
rank, however, was respected;	I received	f	i
every indulgence that stie state I had embraced	||
would	Jh
f
i
\
-V '
116
would allow me; my conduct won me the affectionate regards of the sisterhood: and I was verging toward some degree of contentment, when, at a public ceremony of admitting a lady into her noviciate with us, I first beheld your son. It was impossible for me to avoid observing his particular attention ; his eyes were riveted to me, and seemed to pierce my very heart. Though I felt a rising vanity at this event, it would soon have passed away, had I not received, in a very few days, a written declaration of his passion.
That declaration, and every letter which has passed between us, you will receive w ith this : they wall tell you, Madam, in language which 1 must strive to remember no more, the progress of our loves, the consequence of them, and the final cause of this address to you.
I shall not trouble you with a detail of that affection which will be the misfortune and scourge of my future days:—the papers which accompany this letter, if you should deign to read them, w ill communicate the ardor of my passion, and the right I had to expect the most	I
generous	I.
1
i
117	T
'r ■
generous returns from that of your son. Per-	'
init me, however, to mention, that a solemn	’
public marriage, sanctified by your approba-	^
tion, was the condition upon which I under-	.'i ^
took the hazardous enterprize of flying from	i| i
the convent, and hastening to tliis kingdom.	1 I
On my arrival here, Mr. Croli treated me	i I
with a most flattering and respectful attention,	I ’
and offered those excuses for your delay in visiting me, which my credulous affection	T
made me willing to believe—At length, how-	Lr
ever, my eyes were opened; and I atvoke to	M
all the horrors of my deplorable situation.-1	j
discovered that my virtue was not merely sus-
pected, but absolutely lost in the public opi-	|C
nion; and that I was intended to be the dupe	kM
of Mr, Croli’s future artifice, in order to be-	flfl
come the very abominable character with	jSi
which common fame had already disgraced
me.—It was now time to enter upon a positive	wp
explanation: I wrote, therefore, to your son	ji|^S
on the subject, in terms of the deepest afllic-	® j
tion; and he returned the answer which you
will read, wherein he throws ofl' the mask at
once,	i:
jj
I
118
chce, and makes an open and most daring
proposal to me to become his mistreiss.--—It	i
really astonidlies me that the moment of read-	!
ing the paper, whereon the infamous proposition was written, did not prove my last!- ■ —
Alas 1 such an event would have been merciful to me.—But Heaven inspires me with strength to bear my present griefs, that it may inflict upon me its future punishment.—In this state,
Madam, with all the tortures of disappointed affection, with all the pangs of wounded honour, and the angry smart of insulted love,
I had to expect the bitter reproaches of those who accompanied my flight: but my despair was not yet to be accomplished; and their tender consolations sustained me into existence.
They were the means of my escape, have been the companions of my danger, and were to have been rewarded by a share in my happiness ; but disappointment, instead of allaying, gave new force to their friendship, and they have given me, in my adverse state, those proofs of affection which is not in the
honours	«|

honours and prosperity of this world to re-	i
ward.	1 5
There was, fortunately for me, in this alarming exigence, one person of whom I	j
could ask advice and assistance, and he has	i |
proved himself a friend indeed. This gentle-	1
man is a Mr. L------, an Italian merchant of	‘ ■
eminence and respect, whom I had occasion to see on my first arrival in this kingdom. To	j :
the female friend wlio accompanied me hither,	A i
1 had long ago entrusted tile little treasure	\ A |
which was saved from she injustice of rela-	? i!
tions and the rapacity of the convent; of this	S
she was a faithful steward. Previous to our	]
quitting Italy, she joined her little fortune to	1I
it, and procured letters of credit to Mr. L--,	j
to whose care she whole of it was consigned	, I* j
on our arrival in England. As I was deter-	L %
mined never to receive any thing from your	i	|
son till he had given me a nuptial interest in	^ y ,
his possessions, it became a matter of necessity	j ^
to pay occasional visits to this gentleman :-- I f \
he appeared to be a man oI‘ amiable dispo-
sitipns; and 1 trusted to that api)earance in '	Ij

myself. He kindly hastened to grant my request, and without any hesitation or reserve	‘
bn my part, I told him the all of my sad his-	,
tory, declared to him my resolution of returning to the walls that I had abandoned, and braving the rigours that would ineet me there;—and entreated his assistance to point out to me the most ready means of compleat-ing my purpose.—My story melted him into tears: and, after much kind endeavour, on his part, to turn me from my design, as well as a thousand friendly offers of service, finding that I was irrevocably determined, at all events, to bid an immediate farewell to this country, he persuaded me not to throw myself, into the angry power of my Ibririer sisterhood, nor add to the miseries of my life by tempting the pious fury of their punishment.—
I listened to his humane counsels, and, before this letter reaches you, ■shall be proceeding on my way to a retirement which he will not disco; er, and w here I ma\Lrellect, w ithout interruption,

terruption, on tlie future disposition of my
days,------This, Madam, is a short history of	*
myself to the moment when I have the honour	ir
of addressing’ myself to you ; I intend it only	\
as a kind of outline which the correspondence	ji
between your son and myself will fill up,	j
and as an introduction to a few short ohser-	^
vations, and one poor request, which will • i conclude it.	1
I am worthy of the honour, Madam, to	I	i
which I aspired, of being your daughter.	||	,
Permit me to say that my affection for	’
Mr. C------was of that nature as to have most	t
deeply interested	me in	every	relation and con-	I
ceni of his, His friend would have been my	. H
friend:----his mother would have been my	> e
mother; and I	should	have	considered	it	as	^	1
the pride of my life to have administered, by every affectionate duty, by evoiy kind atten-
tion, to the comfort of yours.----His we alth	|| ^
liad no influence upon my heart: what I	jjj
thought a	rare superiority of character won
me to him	; and, if foul fortune had made him	}
poor, my	fidelity w^ould never have shrunk,	^
M	but	S
:f
I
122
but most willingly shared his poverty with him. This I may now assert without vanity,	>
or without being accused of views from whose gratification I am already removed.—
What I have asserted is the truth;—your son knows it to be so, and will hereafter acknowledge if. ' '	•
I can have no motives to make these declarations, but such as my heart tells me are just;—for if your son were at this moment, to offer on his knees, and with that afiecting language which won my love, to fulfil his former vows; though you, his venerable parent, were to enforce his entreaties with your own, I call a just God to witness that
I would refuse it all!-----The insult he has
offered to me has rendered him unworthy of me ; and there is no misery I would not suffer	f
with pleasure, rather than be united to the	|
man who has harboured the intentions to in-	I
jure my honour, and to hold me forth to the world as an unchaste name.—If this is the language of Pride,—it is that Pride which is the best protector of Virtue,
I da

I do not, indeed I do not, quit all my fond-hopes oS happiness without a regret that £ cannot describe, and which, I still love the au-	■ '
thor of my misery so well, as to wish that he	;
may never feel. I suffer for my credulity,	|
the offspring of a blind and fatal passion; and	I
the pangs it has riveted in my heart, will, I	;
fear, remain there, till I am no more. My honour is still my own; I possess the purity *	? i
of a fair fame, though calumny has endea-	.
voured to rob me of it; and I entreat you.
Madam, whenever it may be in your power, to do me justice.—Alas! I little thought that the	j
only letter I should ever address to you would	'
be of this melancholy nature:—I little thought that a necessary act of self-justification from me would ever be hostile to your repose, and wound your parental affections. I had hoped to be the comfort of your declining years,	|
and I am forced by a sad necessity to give	|
them a subject for lamentation. Why did I	I
live to this hour! and wherefore have I	||
strength to survive it!—Must my first address	;	'

If your own conscience does not make you tremble at the sight of this letter, you may peruse its contents without apprehension ; it will contain neither accusation nor reproach, and is the last you will ever receive from me.

path

path I have taken, and to pursue me, your labour will be in vain. I have already given you sufficient proofs of a resolution which is	• '
capable of maintaining its purpose in spite of any fatigue or danger; and I think it my duty to assure you, that neither the powers nor temptations of this world will be able to shake it for a moment. I call Heaven to witness, whom I have offended, and whose future	j
w'rath I shall endeavour to deprecate by immediate atonement, that I never will, if I can prevent it, see or hear from you again :—but, if a too curious imprudence should obtrude you upon me in the retreat whither I am hastening, know. Sir, that yon will hear nossiing	'
there but the reproach of insulted virtue ; you will find nothing there but a determined pur-* pose to turn my back for ever on the man who has so basely injured me: and though he	j
were to renew every former declaration; though he were ready to sanctify, in the most ‘ sacred manner, his former engagements: he would find a steady and inflexible denial, which nothing can overcome. I desire you,	;
M 3	therefore,	^
H'
i'
'4
126
tlierefore, to spare me, as well as yourself, the pain and mortification of such an interview. There can be no occasion for your '	^
adding another pang to the heart which has already suftered more than I thought it would be ever able to sustain. You may as well attempt to command the winds; the ocean’s raging tide would be as obedient to your will as my purpose; and may the protection of Heaven eternally forsake me whenever I shall change it!——I trust you know me too well to entertain the faintest hope of such an event.
What have I not done for your sake! I exposed myself to the resentment of my country, and to the severity of its laws against persons of my habit. I put my life to the hazard, and sought a distant nation to which I was a stranger, to make you happy; and what has been my rew ard ?•—A wounded reputation and	j
your ingratitude.---Heavens! that you, who	j
knew so well the bottom of my heart, should	i
treat me in this manner!----Have you never	'
reflected on your conduct towards me? Have
O'	‘
YOU
I

you forgot all sense of obligation to me?-----
Alas ! your proceedings have not been tliose
of a generous mind, or of an honest indn.-----
I do not wish to know the success of this letter : if it depends upon me, I shall never know it; nor will you, I hope, possess the power to trouble the condition which I prepare for myself.
I have already written to your mother a general account of the beginning, progress, and sad conclusion of our acquaintance with each other: to her possession are also consigned all the letters you have written to me, with the copies of those which you received	'
from my hand: but do not imagine that I adopted such a measure from any motive but my own justification. I thought it right to deposit my fair name with the mother of him who wished to destroy it.—You will dare not	j
to violate her sacred protection.
Leonora, that firm friend, whose fidelity,
■ I trust. Heaven will one day reward, seems	|
to attach herself more closely to me in the	i
hour of my present adversity. She is resolved	•
to	I
128
to share my fate, whatever it may be. I am not bereft of every worldly consolation, when such a friend yet remains. The poor old man, who left his native home for my sake, and suffered his age to repose on those promises of reward which I cannot now fulfil, has found a protector who has promised to give him bread, and cherish him during the lew years of his remaining life. For his sake I request you also to w atch over his repose and contentment. You know the claims he has upon you, and I wash to be the only victim of your injustice.
That I have loved you with the most ardent sincerity, your own heart will bear me witness ;----perhaps I may never cease to love
you. A passion such as mine, whicli has mingled with every principle of my nature, and become, as it were, a part of my existence, will not be easily extinguished:----but
be that as it may, it is nothing to my present purpose ; and the very sentiments tvith which this passion may torment my bosom, w ill act as powerful motives to confirm my resolution
of
I	I
129	'
of never seeing you again. Who could have	i
thought that the fair prospect of our early	|
love would have been so soon obscured, anti	\
that your boasted affection would have given	1
such proofs of its sincerity !—But we must,	|l
in future, be strangers to each other; we must	1
know one another no more. This is a I’arewell	I
for ever!----“That you may be happy is the	|
prayer of my heart; and may she, who sue-	I
ceeds to my right in your affections, equal me	i
in love, and receive in return that constancy	I
which was due to	1
ISABELLA,	I
LETTER XXXT.	1
TO MRS. CROLI.	I
It is not now necessary to tell you the par-	I
ticulars of that cruel act of injustice which	i 11
bears so heavy on the guilty perpetrator, that	' I
he is not able to sustain it. You have, I find, been fully informed of my passion for the first and best of women; you well know the unparalleled
130	■
paralleled proofs she has given me of her affec-^	■
tion, and the more than barbarous returns I	w
have made to it. My happiness is vanished	■
for ever!-----Worse than clouds and darkness	I
hang over me, and the tortures of a wounded,	I
spirit have overtaken me. I might have been	■
the happiest and best of men—I am the most	■
wretched and worst of beings ; and the ills of	■
my fortune are aggravated by an agony of	B
guilt which is intolerable. Hope is lost for	■
ever; the reign of Despair is already com-	B
inenced, and I will not support it. Your son	B
must be the victim of his OAvn injustice. He	■
has some sense of honour left, and that shall	■
redeem the infamy of his name.------1 cannot	■
live !—Pity and forgive me. Madam ; for ere	■■
you read these unwelcome lines, I shall have	I
. well revenged the injured Isabella’s wrongs:— , I my own hand is ready to appease her, and in	I
a few minutes, I shall be no more! It will	I
~	surely be a lesser evil to you that I should be	I
at once in my grave, than be bearing in my heart a fierce corrodingpoison, whose sluggish	I
tortures would at length lead me to it. The	I
last	I
131	I
last act of duty which I can perform to you,	I
is to save you the pain of seeing; me linger	I
through the sad progress of despair and mad-	I
ness. Your aged eyes shall not behold your	1
favourite child stretched on the rack of pain	I
which threatens him :------he will disappoint	I
Sorrow of its cruel aim. The agonies of years	I
have rushed into this hour; and the sharpness	I
of its sufferings will, I trust, compensate in	I
the eye of Mercy for the scene which I am	I
preparing.-----Farewell, thou best and kindest '	I
parent!—Isabella! thou loveliest and most ex-	I
alted of thy sex, thou most injured woman,	I
adieu!—Receive my dying sighs ;—they are	I
s yours !—yet a little while, and the last will	I
have escaped me!	I
Here these Letters conclude; but a note is	|l
added to complete the history. Isabella ar-	I

been a Desideratum in English Literature ; and it was with a view of supplying this defect, that the present Work was undertaken.
It will readily be admitted, a perfect acquaintance with the local History and internal Advantages of our Native Country, is one of the most useful, ornamental, and desirable branches of human Knowledge; and there is not, perhaps, a Country in the World more generally interesting to the Scientific Observer, than that of Great Britain.
In order to render this Work as perfect and useful as possible, correct Mops, and accurate Itineraries, have been considered indispensably necessary.— In treating of the Ancient History of our Island, the most authentic accounts only have been detailed, avoiding mere speculation ; and, in describing Monuments of Antiquity, their present appearance,
■with the opinions of the learned upon their origin, have been deemed -sufficient.—The Topographical Descriptions have been drawn from the best works upon the subject, from original materials, and from actual observation. No pains have been spared in producing authentic historical accounts of \he Andent and Present State of every part of the ■Country. The Name of every Eminent Native will be found recorded with due respect, at the same time that the Work has not been much increased in size by Biographical Memoirs.—The Natural History of the British Islands has claimed particular attention, and details 'have been entered into, as amply as the nature of the Work would allow.	,
Great care has been taken with the Local Trade and Manufactures of	j
every part of Great Britain; and no opportunity has been omitted to	!
point out favourable situations for the exercise of Industry, and the beneficial application of Capital.—And, the Science ofwhich	|
has been so considerably benefited by the Publication of the valuable “ AGRICULTURAL REPORTS OF GREAT BRITAIN,” under the auspices of the Board of Agriculture, will l>e found to have received that share of attention, which the importance of the subject demands.
The Plan of this Work has received particular approbation, from each County being divided into Easy Journies, by which means,Persons, cither riding, or on foot, have the opportunity of viewing many Beauties, which otherwise might be missed.

BELDS BEAUTIFUL EDITION
OF THE
CONSTITUTIONAL CLASSICS,
Complete in Fortp-Jlve Numlers, Price Is.Gd. each^	I
FORMING SEVEN ELEGANT VOLUMES,
BEING A LIBRARY OF
HISTORICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL INFORMATION.
This Edition is prirded in rm elegant Pocket Size, on a beautiful move Paper, of a new fabric, hot-pressed, with a new and clear Type.
Each Number contains Four Sheets of Letter-press, or <i4 Pages ; and, from its unexampled elegance and convenient size, has an advantage over every former Edition of the Works comprised within this Classification.
This Complete Edition of the Constitutional Classics consists of the following Works: viz.
I.
atomittentarir^ oti ttje liaU)0 of ©ngJantr,
Complete in Twenty-eight Numbers.
This Edition contains the pure text of Blackstone, as printed from the last Edition revised by himself; hut the subsequent Statutes, as far as they vary the propositions in the text, are fully given in the Notes; and all other judicial determinations, which alter or (jualify the Author’s original sentiments, are correctly pointed out, and referred to; so that this Edition is what the Author intended, a. Book of Elements and Principtes, and yet exhibiting the actual shape and body of the Law, brought downio, and existing at the present day.
—The Notes, therefore, are upon the same plan as the Work itself; that is, not branching out irfto unnecessary detail, or dilating upon the technical practice of the Courts, iiut embodying only the new Laws, principles, and judicial determinations, introduced and acknowledged’by the Legislature, siuce the last	i
edition.
A copious Index, digested on an entirely new plan, is annexed, and gives it a decided superiority over all other Editions of Blackstone, which are so essentially defective in this material requisite of a Book of Study and Reference.
—A fine Portrait of Blackstone, with his Life, is prefixed to tlie first Number.

This Work is acknowledged to be, a most luminous and masterly arrangement of the principles of the British Constitution.—The Author, being a foreigner, had escaped the contagion of party passions, and had no prejudice to indulge on any side. Neither Whig nor Tory, Aristocrat nor Kepuhlican, he viiwed the mighty fabric of our Government with impartial reverence, and delineated all its parts with sacred truth.
The present Is printed from his last corrected Edition ; to which a few Notes are appended, bringing the history of the Constitution down to the present time.—A fine	of Le Lolmu, with bis Life, is prefixed to the First
lumber.

Of LOCKE on GOVERNMENT, which was the stone upon which was founded, re&red, and established, the glorious Revolution in 1683, all praise would he superfluous. It developes, with the most masterly skill, the principles of all Governments, and the claims of Englishmen to a Free Constitution. It shows, that obedience to Civil Government is submission to the will of God; and that,	|
by the Laws of England, Liberty, Public Prosperity, and Private Happiness,	j
are inseparably connected.

Complete in Five Numbers.	J
Upon these celebrated Letters, nothing in the nature of panegyric, needs be attempted. They are certainly not without considerable virulence and asperity; but they contain the most solid principles of political wisdom and constitutional learning. This Work is not only worthy of being read for its profound and manly exposition of the grounds of British liberty, but for the peculiar el^ance, and polished poignancy of the style in which it is written.
V.

itrOolution,
Complete in Four Numbers.
EURKE’.S REFLECTIONS close this Series;—which appeared, when thecon-vulsicns of the French Revolution shook the Globe like an earthquake, and which, by the unrivalled charm of its reason and eloquence, quenched the thirst for innov.ation, and allayed the rising storm, which threatened to tear us from our homes, our liberties, our altars, and our God.
This has always been deemed a most valuable vindication of our rights and liberties;—upholding equally the Church and State, the prerogative of the Throne, the claims of the privileged orders, and the liberty of the subject. The Scholar should read it for its eloquence,—the Statesman for its wisdom,—and all men for its virtue.
The BRITISH CONSTITUTIONAL CLASSICS afe particularly recommended to the Heads qf Seminaries, :inil Families; by adopting which, the true inti-rest, and the moral and intellectual improvement of the rising generation might be most eflectuilly promoted, and their minds formed to a love and reverence of the laws of their country, and a knowledge of its wise institutions.
It is presumed, the portability and elegance of this Series will render ft peculiarly acceptable to the Students oj our Universities;—it is adapted to the leisure of a morning or evening walk, or to the Contemplation of the study.
With the general reader, these Works mast have their full influence and effect;
.—he cannot but be amply gratilied in perusing these Classics, whose object is not to inculcate new fancies and opinions, hut old and established truths, ve. nerable for their age, and sacred for their utility, and to instruct every English' man in those Rights and Duties, upon which his Public and Private welfare depend,—to cherish in him a generous Loyalty.—a manly love of his own Liberties,!
—and a due value of the glorious Constitution under which ha lives.
Each may be had separately in boards, bound, or in Nuiahers.
