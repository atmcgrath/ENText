LETTER!.
Madam,
IN confequence of the promiSe yoiS fo obligingly exacted when 1 lefc England, I propoSe to impart what-, ever appears to me worthy attention ; and be perSuaded, every pleaSure, of advantage I may receive from my tra-^ ., -vels will be infinitely heightened by your sharing them^ — I will not gives inySelf the trouble of writing, nor yo|ii VoL.

that of reading, what is to be found in every common Journalist; minute descriptions of towns, buildings, histories of reliques, &c. In all thefe, there is So much SameneSs, or folly,
. they can pretend to no merit, except the addition they make to a volume; therefore shall leave them to thofe who . write their travels at home, and have consequently more leiSure. I will endeavour to amuSe you by a general description of the countries in which I reside, and a more particular one of the manners and customs of the inhabitants, as far as I may be in a situation to form a judgment: whatever , I fay, shall have all the merit truth can give; the failures which will proceed from not having a capacity adequate to my-undertaking, I rely upon-your Cj|ndor to pardon. May I not even 3	hope.

your*s.-----=-1 landed at Dieppe; it is a
good port, the town has a pleasing aSpedl from the uniformity of the buildings, their only merit. Not find-* ing any objecsts which deServed attention, I proceeded immediately to Rouen. Normandy is a beautiful pro^ vince, I cannot give you a more juft idea, than by Saying it relembles the finest counties in England, as well in the produce, as the face of the country, yielding all that is necessary to life in the highest perfedtion, and greatest abundance, except wine, of which there are but Small quantities made, and only in the cantons bordering upon the Isse of France; this de-fetst is well Supplied sin my opinion by the finest cyder I ever drank. You will B 2	imagine
[ 4 J
ibiagine I am going to fill my letters as Montagne did his essays, with the particulars of my taste: no ; as I have not his merits, I will endeavour to avoid this and all faults as far as possible, though many foibles may be ex-cuSed in a private letter, which could not in a writing designed for the public. — The city of Rosien is large, but ill built; the whole appears unworthy attention, yet upon examination, there are particulars deferving the highest: being the feat of a parliament, gives it I think a preference to Caen as a place of residence. The premier president has distinguished himSelf by remonstrances which are an equal proof of his capacity, and Patriotism; it is much to be lamented Such talents, when most strenuoussy exerted, cannot have a rea-iij>Rabk hope beyond impunity. When
a long-
[ 5 1
a longer reSidence has given me an Opportunity of receiving information, I shall reSume this Subjed; at preSent will Speak of objetsts of sight, they permitting an immediate judgment. The most considerable buildings in this city are, the cathedral of Notre Dame, and the church belonging to the BenididlinS of St. Osien, both in the Gothic style, built by the English; they are deservedly esteemed fine pieces of architecture, but So nearly reSembling the principal of the ancient churches in England, they had not the merit of novelty. So requisite to admiration; consequently I was not pleaSed equal to the expedlations of thoSe who attended me, they asserting theSe were two of the finest edifices in France.- What were most striking to me, would by no means affed any one who had before B 3	been
[ 6 ]
been in a catholic nation, that is the interior ornaments derived from this religion. You have read So many authors who give a detail of them, I shall not add to their number. In this, as in many other churches, there are eagles amongst the ornaments; Some of the company remarked the impropriety of that figure, as it is generally known to be copied from the decorations in the ancient temples of the Romans, who had the highest veneration for this bird, as a representative of Jupiter. A lady prefent insisted, with great humour, the figure had equal merit as an ecclesiastical ornament, being as just a representative of the priesthood, from the .charadler of a bird of prey, as, from its royalty, of Jupiter. The pleafure of addressing you. Madam, is So great, I can only prevail with mySelf to
con-
[ 7 ■]
conclude by the Superior one of aS-Suring I am with the highest reSpedh and esteem.
Your most obedient, and
Rouen.
most humble Servant, See.
LETTER II.
T O reSume the Subjedt of my lash and to do justice to the clergy whom the lady rallied, I must obferve, as far as my acquaintance extends, they are perSons of great merit and piety; Some of them fine orators : their manner of preaching, without notes, and frequently by addresses to the audience recalling attention, has Something very ani-^ mated, and adds much to the effedt of their eloquence: the English Sermons B 4	' have
[ 8 ]
have a great Superiority in the cLofet, the French as great from the chair; the first Speaks principally to rcaSon, the latter to the passions. Declamation IS a talent never negledted by the French, it even enters into the education of girls, who make Such a pro-greSs in this art, or Science, many a woman declaims in the highest degree of perfedHon, who can only think and
judge in the lowest.--------1 have been
to pay a viSit to the fathers dc la Re-4einption, et de la Trinite; the inducement was to fee their gardens, which command a very fine proSpedl, the environs of this city being exqui-fitely beautiful. You are perhaps unacquainted with this order; the only one in my opinion whoSe existence is uSeful, either to the public or individuals* as I can with more eaSe, and
pre-
[ 9 ]
precision, give an idea of this institution, than the beauties of the proSpeD, I shall begin by faying it obliges them to be perpetually employed. Some at home in raising money, others abroad in disposing of thoSe Sums, for the re-leaSe and conSolation of Christian captives, taken by the Turks or Moors ; this duty they perform with much fatigue and Sometimes hazard of their lives ; their charadlers are correspondent to the piety of their institution. Ladies may be of the confraternity; I am acquainted with Some who are : ail their engao-ement consists in recommendincr, and making this their principal charity. I heard a Sermon by one of theSe fathers on Trinity Sunday, the great day of the order : the preacher, after treating the Subjedl of the feast, with a just reverence and humility, displayed his
do-
[ 10 ] -
eloquence upon the duties required by the institution, and the merit of assisting k; nothing could be more graceful than his adtion and elocution, which were greatly heightened by frequent - references to a pidlure on the opposite fide of the chapel, where Some fathers are represented treating with the Dey of Algiers. The joy of the perSons re-leaSed, the anxiety of the captives who attend that happy moment, the deSpair of others on Seeing the riches of the fathers So much inferior to their benevolence, gave the highest Subjedts for the rhetoric of the orator, as they had before to the art ot the painter; the Succefs of the Speaker was much, very much beyond that of the artist. — I am afraid you will think I am Seized with the Spirit of preaching; pardon the first and last error of this kind; the
preSent
[ “ ]
preSent is the only letter where you v/ill See me dwell upon the merit of a religious order, however reSpedable Some individuals maybe; but here the whole appears So worthy, I cannot conclude till I have Said theSe fathers, after as great a part of life Spent in the duties of their profession as nature will permit, have a hcuSe of peaceable retirement at Montpelier. I Spoke to one of them, who is going there, of the possibility of a general extindion of religious houSes in France : he anfwered, may the duration be equal to their uSe,' ours is lefs necessary than when eredcd, if ever it becomes entirely uSelefs, I wish its destrudion. A long letter upon So grave a Subjed will induce you to give an immediate confent to the favour I ash of Saying I am. Madam,
liGiien. Your most obedient, &c.

P. S. An anecdote I heard of th^ King yesterday, deServes to be related. Passing by la Plaine de Sablons, he Saw the troops assembled for the execution of a Soldier ; aSking the cauSe, was an-Swered the man highly merited the punishment, for he was a coward, and not willing to Serve his majesty. The , king replied. Poor fellow; want of courage is a misfortune; let him live, and Serve me Some other way. I do not : fay there was any particular wiSdom in the decision, (nor could it be general,) but you See humanity and mercy, the I darsing attribute of heaven.	j

LETTER III.
A Company 'of playCrs being arrived, I went to fee them perform. The French, who are very jealous of the honor of their theatre, desire I will fuSpend my judgment till I have been at Paris; but I fay to them as to you, from what I See of thefe adors, I conceive the merit of thoSe at the capital must be very great. The play I Saw was les Freres Ennemis; Sure never were wrote four lines with kSs SenSe, or more mal-a-propos, than thoSe Racine makes Cleon utter upon the death of Antigone;
Amll done vous fuyzez un Amant Odieux Et vous meme cruelle eteignez vos beaux yeux Vous fermez pour jamais ces beaux yeux que j’adore,
Et pour ne me point voir vous les fermez encore.
Do
'	[i4]
Do you net think there is Somethirto;
So ingenious in the demonstration of Antigone’s hatred (shuting her eye's again after she had shut them for ever) that it is impossible to find in ancient ' or modern poetry any thing wshich can pretend to a comparison, except the two following lines quoted by the Spcctatcr:
A painted vest Prince Vokiger had on.
Which from a naked Pid his grandiire won.
Some perSons perhaps would lessen the merit of my countryman from his , antiquity, but there are points where ' the advantages and privileges of the ' ancients and moderns are equal. I have heard rhyme is a terrible restraint upon a great genius; it may be So: but I- am Sure it is not unfavorable to a moderate one, for the most ordinaty
u der-
[ 15 1
understanding could not Support ch<‘ nonSenSe of the above quoted lines, if they had been in proSe : our poem has long been antiquated, for Racine’s I am perSuaded Several French read it to this day without discovering the absurdity. As to the impropriety of dwelling upon the beaux yeux of a per-fon in Antigone’s situation, which raiSes a general tenderneSs andassiiCtion instead of particular admiration, and the inconsistency of love v/ith the general character of Cleon, I do not wonder they receive no cenSure ; being in the style of the nation. I know Racine ex-GuSes himSelf with regard to the faults of this piece, by Saying it was a juvenile performance. To paSs by the defests in general; yet a boy, if he ^ould write a tragedy at ten years old, yyould not be pardoned thofe four lines..
Indeed
[ *6 ]
Indeed a child could not err So much against nature. It is astonishing Racine should not corred or erafe them, when at a' more mature age he wrote the preface to this piece. His Athaliah is ' -a fine poem, and he has Some other pieces of merit; in general, I do not think he deServes the great applauSe the French give him ; he often falls / into the error of drawing all his cha-raders So like his countrymen: from whatever nation he takes them, antique or modern, he brings to my remembrance a very common story I have heard, of a painter, who was desired to paint the sign of a red lion ; as he was only capable of drawing one figure, and that not the requisite, he made many excuSes to avoid attempting any other; At last upon the perSon’s insisting, he Said, if you will have a red lion, you
shall
t 17 ]'
shall have a red lyon ; but I give you notice, it will be extremely like a role.—-I am. Madam, with great regard,
Roden. Your most obedient, &c,
LETTER IV.
I A M this moment returned from, the Cour, it is the most beautiful walk that can be imagined; you pafs the Seine by a bridge of boats, esteemed a great curiosity; being construded in Such a manner, the heaviest carriages go over ' with Safety, and it is opened with much facility for the passage of ships: on the left of the bridge is the Cour, which is a considerable length, planted very beautifully, and though wery wide, VoL. I. ^	C	covered
[ 18 1
covered by the uniting of the trees. The river on one side, and the hills rising into an amphitheatre ; the view into the country, in the front, and reairning, that of the ships, quay, and town in the front; form a Scene as variegated, and pleasing, as ever I beheld : this charming Cour is not in general much frequented by people of fashion; but on AScension-day, the equipages are very numerous, and the citizens with the peafants innumerable.. I do not know that I was ever more struck, with dreSs, than by the variety the femak peafants prelented. The province of Normandy has Several di-stri(sts, each has a peculiar habit. Some are very graceful and sine ; the women of the Pais de Caux are more distinguishable by the Superiority of their figiares than their drefs, except to
French
«»
r 19 ]
French men, who are as much charmed by the one as the other, I could not help thinking I Saw the inhabitants of twenty, difierent nations, when I was only be-^ holding the peaSants of Normandy, who came from every part of the province, rather to honour the patron Saint of the city, than the great and general festival celebrated the fame day. This Saint, as their legend teaches, attended by two malefaftors, killed a dragon that laid waste the country; in memory of tliis event, the canons of the cathedral have a right to demand the releafe of one prifoner capitally convided. A gentleman, who killed ' his Servant in a passion, received the ■benefit of this anniverfary.. A ridiculous circumstance is Said to have happened fome years since at the procession, when the reliques of the faint and si-■C 2	gure
[ 20 ]
■gure of a dragon are carried about the city, an old woman So much mistook the objedl of veneration, she kneeled and Said her Ora pro nobis to the beast, instead of the faint. Incredible as this may appear, the next festival gave a proof the woman was not singular in her regard for the dragon, though rather outree. The procession beginning without him, the disappointment was So great, and the fury cf the people aroSe to Such a height, they threatened to Set sire to the epiScopal . palace, if the dragon was not produr ced; in conSequence of this tumult, he wTas reinstated in all his honors, which I believe no one since has dared to diSpute. Whenever you find my letters neither entertaining nor instructive, which I fear will be very often, treat them with the contempt they de-
Serve,
[ 21 ] ' '
Serve, and though I hope you will pardon their defefts, do not honor them with So precious a tribute as your time.
A French man in company has led me into the trivial digression above, but it • -is my own Sentiments diredt, when I have the pleaSure of professing the high esteem with which I am, Madami-
Roilen, Your most obedient, &c. .
L E T T E R V.
I-a- E Palais is worthy attention, the parliament who there preside, are So in a much higher degree ; as far as my knowledge permits, I will Speak of tlieSe magistrates. I am perSuaded you know the word parliament in France, '
‘ -	L 3	has
[ 2* ]
has by no means the Same acceptation as in England; though the perSons who compofe that, of this nation, assert the identity of their original privileges and fundUons. The diScusion of this point would carry me beyond tlie limits of my preSent design; I will only fay, however reSembling in their origin, the British has gained, and, perhaps, the French lost. So many privileges, and fp much pov/er, at prefent there is Scarce any reSemblance but in name: the principal light in which a French parliament is to be considered, as to its effedls, is, the first court of justice in the kingdom ; to which all perSons, not content with the judgment of the magistrate where they reside, may appeal: there are likewiSe cauSes never within the cognizance of inferior courts. Tlie parliament is compoSed of presidents a
mor'
[ ^3 ]
mortier, (So called from a bonnet or cap they wear) presidents, and conSeil-leirs de parlement; the difference of theSe, consists rather in precedency, and points of honor, than any distinct privileges ; the presidents a mortier Say they represent the peers, tvho compoSed a part of the ancient parliaments ; the presidents claim a Superiority over the counSeilldrs, which the latter do not allow; this is certain, they all sit in 'judgment together, and give thtir voices; the advocates anSwering to the counsellors in England, being pleaders. I'here are considerable offices attending the parliament, as procureur-gene-ral, &c. all charges are venal, which appears at first sight a great defedl; but I am convinced the duties of theSc offices are much better performed, than it the perSons were appointed by the C 4	c( u :
[ 24 ]
court: in general, the Son buys the place of his father, and So on for many generations; a certain point of honor defcends with the office, which could not be expefted in thofe whoSe interest with the ministry procured this magistracy ; as in the first family honor is joined to perfonal reputation. It is true. Some rich merchants purchaSe thefe charges for their Sons, as it gives a Sort of nobleSs (though not the first); but their number being Small, they are carried away by the Spirit of the body, which is that of the public good, wdien-, ever they have the privilege of asserting it. In the decision of cauSes I believe they are very just, many circumstances combining to render their corruption more difficult than other courts in France. The great number of per- j Sons of Superior merit, who compoSe
the
[ 25 ] ,
the parliaments of this nation, makes me wish the word Protection was never knovrn, as it is thoSe v/ho have cauSes depending. Sometimes endeavour’ to form an interest with their judges, in a more attentive manner than could be, if SucceSs w^as absolutely impoffible to be gained by that method. I never consider the constitution and govern-
O	«
ment of other nations, without applauding my own, which I think Mon-teSquieu obServes, is as near perfedHon as any can be, which is formed by mortals.—A Seat may be bought in parliamient at twenty-one, but they have no vote till twenty-five; the early age at which they enter this assembly is no inconveniency, on the contrary, requisite-, as they very often have not follcwcd any study proper to the profession; but the time of giving their
votes
I z6 ]
-votes fiiould be retarded, their ignorance might be corredled by the knowledge of otliers, if their youth did not incline them to take their passions for their guides. However, the majority -wnl ever be juft. In general, the women are employed to make interest in ail affairs in France, even though the principal perSon concerned is of the other Sex; you wdil pardon me, madam, if I do not imagine it is alv/ays their Superiority of genius which gives them i this preference. Is it not a great de-fedj; in the manners of a people, when a ; woman can quit her dignity and dclica- | cy fo far, as to become a fuppliant, and | as great a defeft in the constitution to ' fuffer her, if manners could be controlled by laws ?

P. S. At a Supper where I was present, amongSc Several Bon mots which were repeated, one I think is good; it was Said upon m.arShal Saxe’s going to be interred in Germany : What, not one de Profundis for him who e;ave us So many Te Deums ! to illustrate the lady’s wit, perhaps, I should tell you the pfalm de Profundis is Sung before the corpSe in the burial fervice of the Roman church. I thought none but a Roman catholic could have been Marshal of France ; am told they made this objeftion to Saxe; who anstvercd. My fword is a good catholic ; which was accepted withcut .any farther profession. Be this as it will, historical truth is not neceffary to what I have related : perhaps the occasion was made for the Bon mot, instead of the Eon mot for the occasion. Tire French are fo fond
of
[ 28 ]
of this kind of wit, they have a Say-; ing, Que les Francois Se damneront pour un Bon mot.
L E T T E R VI.
I WA S last night at the Cid, a piece which though it gave rife to the best ' Satyr in this language, yet gave me very great pleaSure; an English man does not insist upon being pleafed according to rules, or he could not be So highly charmed by ShakeSpear: Corneille, in the tragedy of which I am Speaking, has Succeeded better than the French generally do in foreign characters ; they are more acquainted with the SpaniSn than any nation, except
[ 29 ]
cept the English, and have from the Royal Relation, conire«fi;ions with them, they have not with us. I do not think the French writers Succeed in British charadters, with them we are all mercantile and rough; they do not comprehend the variety in England: a commercial nation we certainly are, and compared to the French, perhaps our manners in general may be plain; but amongst a great number of other charadlers, you may See in England more accomplished men, and as fine gentlemen, as any that ornament the court of France. The Spanish cha-radler is known and represented with more facility than the English, as it consists of few points Strongly marked, not in the least diversified. The French, though public interest and alliances unite them to the Spaniards, yet think
and
t ]
and Speak of that nation with hatred and contempt; I know not from whence this Can proceed, except contrariety of disposition. I have obServed the most distinguistied merit can Scarce reconcile the French to a grave refer-ved character; they look upon the Spanish nation as in a state of total ignorance and darkneSs; of whicli the following fable, quoted against them hj a v/it of my acquaintance, is a proof; it i's new to me, an idea it may > be the fame to you, engages me to
o-ive it as near as the transtation whii , &
permit in the wmrds of the Speaker-------- •
Adam being desirous to know and I ' See his race, whofe numbers had overspread the earth, anuFame had reached the Isteavens; particularly the Europeans as the m.ost disti’iguished; detem 1	mined

mirled to visit the celebrated stations of this part of the globe. He deScended in the kingdom of France : arts, agriculture, arms, and architecture had So entirely changed the face of the earthy and the inhabitants, he immediately disclaimed them as his offspring. He then turned his steps to Germany, Holland, and England yet found nothing to awaken his paternal affedlion t but the moment he cast his eyes upoit the Spanish realms, the great progenitor’s heart was filled with rapture :• Behold 1 Said he, TheSe, TheSe, are my true Children, in whom time has made no change; they and their country are . in the Same state that I and nature left them.”
This Fable has, ist my opinion, as much praife, as reproach, though the
latter
[ 3i= ]'	_	^
latter is intended. If the Spaniards-have made leSs improvements in the arts , and Sciences, than other nations, they have, as I am informed, and as this
t
Satyr allows, preSenred a greater degree of truth and sincerity : qualities which in the affairs of life, highly compenSate every deficiency, and no others can Supply their defect; even in Society they are the most pleasing and requisite.
Wit and knowledge may charm for a time, but lasting Satisfadtion can alone be found where truth is the didtator; j witnefs the hours, days, and years, perfons of Superior genius paSs with thofe, from whoSe conversation they ; can receive no joy,- or Solace, except hearing and Ipeaking with freedom. I. know a coterie in France compofed of i perfons who have Seen each other almost ' every day for twenty years, without
3
i
[ 33 ]
any other tye than friendship; the greatest talents cannot find topics constantly interesting in ,themfelves, but all become So in Such a Society; liberty and truth give charms beyond expression to the meerest trifle. “To many vices a siian may be inclined by constitution (Says a good writer) but no man is a constitutional liar ;” far otherwise, we not only enter the world true, but continue the Same, till Sometimes, finding we play sterling against'counters, to be upon a par with others we quit that virtue which has no equivalent ; in the pleasing view of passing my life in an union, I hope truth her-Self has formed, I am, Madam,

The attachment of each province to its particular ufages, has hitherto, and I besieve ever will prevent * this Scheme taking place. I have heard the parliaments have had a desire to form themSelves into one body, but the strength they might acquire by Such , an union, is too well apprehended for that union ever to be permitted ; how greatly the parliament of Bretagile has distinguished ItSelf is well known, and the conSequences. The members are all' perSons of high birth; to which D 2	their
[ 36 ]
their Sentiments are adequate ; in them has been Seen to what the privilege of remonstrances are reduced; the privilege is no leSs than giving counSel to the king, but the effedls are frequently no other than might be expected from a petition, except the danger. I do not find the most Spirited remonstrances at preSent are attended with any other conSequences, than the diSgrace of the authors by the court, and the applauSe of a few wife men; all struggles are vain for the liberty of thoSe who have not the Spirit to deSire and affert this blessing, the greatest mortals can knov,^, if they have been accustomed to it; but there must be a total change in the manners and Sentiments of the French to render them capable of enjoying Such happineSs. The Subjedl in which I am engaged appears too diffusive for a letter.

I Have been to pay a visit to the Poor Claires : convents are places I do not much frequent; but this being composed entirely of English, it was a compliment due to the nuns; it is of all orders the most rigid, being a reform D 3	upon

Upon the Benediftins: they do not appear even at a grate; a wall with iron Ipikes was between us during the conversation; their voices are So attenuated by fasting and mortification, they Sounded like that of Lungs in the Alchymist, when he fays the fire burns blue ; they have a great though mistaken piety ; a lady of the VavaSour family presides with Superior merit: wherever the English hWc convents, they are distinguished even by the , French ; but it is a reputation I should never wish them to acquire, as I think they are too valuable in every charadter of life to quit it. I v/as prefent not long since when a beautiful young girl took the habit, but that beauty will Soon be faded by the austerities of her life : she performed the ceremony with •reat chearfulneSs, when she quitted

the habit of the world, the ornaments of which she flings from her with the greatest diSdain; she disappeared for Some time, then came into the choir in a white habit and garland of flowers; the choir is very long, and with the nuns arranged on each side in black, and iil-drest, (for they wear their habits nine years) she really looked like Something descended from the heavens ; it was impossible to behold this amiable figure without the utmost regret; for notwithstanding the Satis fatlion which then appeared in her countenance, I fear she will ere long have other Sentiments : but to leave So melancholy a Subjed, I will relate a chearful event, told to me by a Superior of a convent: a young lady was Sent to one of theSe religious houSes by her parents, who intended (as is most cruelly and fre-D 4	quently
[ 40 3
quently the caSe) to force her to take the veil; she having far other views for herSelf, befought them most humbly and earnestly to releaSe her; but was only anSwered by the most cruel threats if she did not comply with their commands : at length, she conSented to fix the day ; when amidst the concourSe of people, who attended the ceremony, was Seen a young gentleman, to whom the intended nun’s affeclions were known to be engaged; nor was there any objection to the marriage, except the other children being not So rich : all the Spectators were Surprized the gentleman could be preSent at a ceremony, that was melancholy even to indifferent people who have Sentiment; but how great was their astonishment increased, when upon the lady’s approach, instead of the uSual ceremony,
she
[ 41 ]	'	,
she declared in the form of marriage, she took that gentleman for her huS-band ; to which he anSwered in the Same terms, ae-reeable to their eno-ap-e-ment: the confusion of the parents being too great to expreSs an immediate dilapprobation, the contradl, being made in the preSence of the bishop, was judged good, and the marriage followed. I should imagine the parents were glad to compromise the affair, for they had intended to commit an adtion as unlawful, as the lady’s marrying without their conSent. If upon thefe occasions a girl has courage, and friends to assist her, in making a protest before she takes the veil, her vow, as being involuntary, is void ; but they are in general So frightened, watched, and per-siiaded, very fev/ can defend themSelves.

Some gentlemen of the robe, and an officer, V/..0 adds to the Science of his profession, (i i v/hich he has been diS-

good
[ 45 ]
good Society : you have Seen in Voltaire, though a colonel, (and I know inferior officers) m.ay dine with the king, a chancellor cannot; but I conclude the king may break through the etiquette if he pleaSes : he is not So diSpoSed, if it is true that he forbad m.ademoiffelle D’cguilly, the famous Amazon, to hunt with him ‘after she married a president: I should not imagine his majesty could be So defective in politeneSs to the Sex. As to the general contempt for the robe, and honor for the gens d’epee, it is too much the interest of the court to be continued: notwithstanding theSe courtly Send- ' ments, many of the parliament are good gentlemen of birth, have all high rank in their province, and great merit to the nation.

UPON my arrival at Amiens, the capital of Picardy, I enquired for the objects which deServed attention; they showed me tlie cathedral, a very sine large edifice, with a profusion of carving and ornaments, as uSual in Gothic buildings; it has been a dilpute wliether this church is a work of the English or French, the preSent decision is in favour of the latter, to which I Submit; Some of the carvings are
' ap-
[ 47 I
apparently English from their Siibjeclis ; if the French chufe to claim them, I do not think they deServe a contest. I might have Seen, as the Sacristan af-Sured me, the real hand of John the Baptist, but as 1 have heard of a gen-tlemaii who has Seen Seven equally authenticated, I did not think one a curiosity wmrth regarding. From the cathedral I went to the Lautoir, a beautiful and extenSive walk, much preferable to the ramparts: the French embellish theSe Sort of public places more than we do; indeed we have Scarce anj
\
in provincial towns, and in France few boroughs are without them : the plan- ' tations on the public roads add much to their beauty, and that of the country. Amiens is a great trading city; I should rather fay, most of the inhabitants are engaged in commerce, but it
is ■
[ 4^ ]
is very far fi-om being in a fiou-rishiiig state. The genius of the French is by no means adapted to busineSs, the great passion for dreSs and dissipation in the low people, is incompatible with the Spirit of commerce. Lyons and Some other towns Succeed from the great advantage of their situation; but where-cver the principal hopes are founded upon French industry, they will fall to the ground: the nature of their government, tends to the encouragement of idleneSs, as does their religion; the great number of convents, holidays,
• perpetual processions, the prodigious standing army, which takes the men | from their labour when young, and | Sends them home to increaSe the number of beggars wshen old; all theSe cauSes combining, it is no wonder here are, as I am informed, three thouSand

After whar I have Said, you will not be Surprized I Spend my time rather in study‘s than Society. I would pay a visit to' the celebrated Moiisi Gresset, author of the Vert Vert, who resides in this city 5 but as he is grown a devot, I am afraid he ceaSes to be a wit.

Swcred, he had another piece, of equal force, ready for the prefs, against the fecular clergy. The bishop thought proper to make peacej by giving Such benefices as his situation permitted him to accept; for though educated, with the intentions 'of his friends, to be a jcfuit, he quitted that Society, and married. As I have mentioned the bishop, it will be but justice to fay, he is equally distinguished for his piety and morality, with an unaffetsted, affable, and chearful behaviour to all who preSent themSelves. It is impossible, when you first refiedt upon the merit of this venerable old man, not to think with Pope,
For modes of faith let gracelefs zealots fight;
His can’t be wrong, whofe life is in the right.
But, upon farther consideration, though one cannot, approve of fighting, yet it must be wished, as his zeal is So great,

I have known Some perfons in England, who would rather be for ever silent than Speak any thing in general Society, unbecoming the genius which distinguishes them. This cha-ratster has certainly much dignity ; but dignity is inconsistent with the general humor of the French. Vive la bagatelle is their language, and their adlions^ are correlpondent. The communicative disposition of this nation, is Sometimes disagreeable, but is frequently
uSeful

They add to tMs desire 6f talking, an astonishing curiosity, which proceeds from an incapacity of entertaining themfelves, aiid is highly inconsistent with that good brfefed-ing fame has given them: fhey will aSic every possible question concerhing yosir-felf, family and affairs, and in return leave nothing unSaid which regards theirs: the misfortune is, I and most English * are too incurious to render the pleaSure reciprocal. I have often been in French company, who justify the following observation of La Bruycre, Ils parlent un moment avant que de penfer: a Frenchman alone could have had that idea.

T H E Porte Saint Denis, by which I entered Paris, is very handSome; the city in general is not adequate to So fine
an

an entrance ; the streets are extremely narrow, and in all points much inferior to thofe of London : here are Some very beautiful places ; Vendome pleafes by the regularity of the buildings ; but that and the Place de Vidloires, are much leSs than Several Squares in London. The Place de Louis (^uinze, will be extremely fine, in all reSpeds, when it is finished. The Hotels already ered-ed, are most magnificent, and of ex-quiSite architedure: thofe of the nobility, in general, are very grand, much Surpassing the houSes of perfons of the fame rank in England: but the citi • zens of London are better lodged than people of that clafs in Paris. The capital of each nation demonstrates the Spirit of its government : Paris has most magnificence; London is more equally handSome. Luxury and po-E 4	verty.
C 56 ]
ycttyj riche$ and eafe, form the cha-rafters and contrast of thefe great cities. In Paris, the whole expence of ^e l^ingdom, is for the king and nobility ; in London, for the people in general. St. James’s is called a palace, ns it is the lodging of a king: the Louvre, Luxemburg, &c, qommand this title from their own grandeur and magnificence. However inferior we may be in royal buildings, England has railed to God, and built for the public, edifices, to which France can shew no equal. The walks in Paris are very-charming ; but of thefe you have heard fo much from your acquaintance, I shall not enter into particulars. Most of the hotels of the nobility have gardens, and all courts, which renders them more agreeable to the inhabitants, but leSs ornamental to the city. I was
walk-
t 57 ]
%
walking in the Thuilleries, with a man of quality, the other day, and remarking the great number of palaces the king of France never inhabits, particularly the Luxemburg (which is repairing, though unfinished) I Said, laughing, I wished one of them could be transported into England, for the uSe of his Britannick Majesty. To my infinite Surprize he anSwered, with great warmth, he SuppoSed I had rather See the king of England poffeSs it in France ; adding, that day would never arrive. It was with difficulty I convinced him my meaning did not go beyond my expression, affuring him, ‘ at the Same time, the wishes of the English were not greater than thoSe of the French. I acknowledge, in this affair, Le Bruyere’s observation might, » in Some degree, be applied to me ; but
I have
[ 58 ]
I have not hitherto lived with people who are SuSceptible; I find they are more So in the capital, than the provinces. They are Sensible of the Superiority we had in the late war, and think w'e are as much elated, as I have heard that nation was when SucceSs was theirs; this inclines them Sometimes to construe as an affront, what is intended as a compliment. A French gentleman observing the Superiority of the English in their knowledge of languages, was an-Swered, C’est un acquit qui ne vous est point neceffaire, car pour la langue, vous, donnez le ton a toute I’Europe, ct vous monsieur. Said the Frenchman, in anger, Vous le donnez fur les armes : Flow can we love the English ? they more than hate, they deSpiSe us. TheSe Sentiments have been taken from English authors, which it is the mode to .	^	study
3
[ 59 ]
study, or rather read ; for no one who visits this kingdom, and is received into the Societies, could be So ill-bred and impolitic, as to Say any thing that might offend, except by accident; which could not have So strong an ef-fedl. Whatever are the Sentiments of the nation, the English are, in general, well received ; many give their esteem and merit; it should be reciprocal. High as Voltaire has drawn the cha-radSer of the French noblesse, in point of honor, he has not more than rendered them justice. Whenever the arms of this nation are attended with fuccels, the glory is all theirs : the love of life ' and pleaSure are So strong in the French, there can be no principle to balance it in the common people; but the high Sentiment of honor in the noblesse, is more than equivalent to any '	dil-
[ 6o ]
disadvantage they may receive from nature and education. The nobility, in general, are much leSs learned than in England : this is not Surprizing upon refiedlion ; favor at court is the first ' merit, and arms the only honorable means of Serving their country; consequently the Science they most endeavour to acquire. Education, in general, is much inferior to the British. The wife and unprejudiced part of the nation, are Sensible, and lament that it is So. The partizans of the Jefuits assert their expulsion will be injurious to the public in this point: they certainly poffefs much learning; but I cannot fay here are great proofs they communicated their knowledge to the kingdom in general. The fathers of the •oratory, who had before a considerable , share in the education of youth, will
now
[ 6i ;
now have a greater. TheSe are a Set of learned and honest men, who, perhaps, may give as much knowledge, with better principles, to their pupils ; they are not engaged by vows, but live in a Society which they are always at liberty to quit; but generally continue in to the end of life, if no particular event recalls them to the world. Some of theSe fathers have been charged with JanSenifm ; an accuSation not uncommon against thoSe who regard morality as an essential part of religion, cither by their doctrine, or their lives. I know a priest who, in a Sermon, told the women of his parish, they had much -better be faithful wives, good mothers, and peaceable neighbours, than visit Notre Dame de Clery, and there make vows to wear white or brown : he w^as immediately called a JanSenist, and,
jo
\
[62}
in a more conSpicuous situation, might ’ have been interdidted ; for his life would wsitneSs against him, being per-fedt as that of man can be. I know a gentleman who Said, he thought there could be difference enough between the English and French nation, to make the latter worth visiting; nothing would Serve him but the Antipodes ; I think, in Some points, he might here find them in Sentiments.

colledlion of paintings with which it is ornamiented. I had much regret in Seeing Some, that once adorned the palaces of the kings of England, and were fold by Oliver Cromwell. To Speak of ' all the piestures, with my Sentiments upon them,would make a large volume; the catalogue malces a Small one: indeed the great quantity and variety Scarce leave a power of dwelling upon any.; yet one has So particularly struck me, I wish I could give the ideas as strong as they are imprinted on my mind : this admirable piece is the Ma-dona with the child JeSus, and St. John ; nothing can exceed the beauty, nor the propriety of the beauty, given to the virgin. In our Saviour, the innocence of the child is’ blended with the wiSdom of the divinity, in a most marvellous manner. In St John, the propriety '

priety of character is equally preServed ;
,amidst the beautiful Smiles of the playing infant, may be diScerned the grow- , ing SanDity of the preacher : this piece is by Raphael; it is styled. La Jardiniere, from the dreSs of the Madona.
I was So highly pleaSed with theSe * paintings, I Sat at home the vrhole even-V ing to enjoy them in idea. I have been at the Luxemburg palace to See the gallery ; Rubens’ design is very great, and the paintings are a just and noble ornament to the apartment; but there are too many faults, nor are their beauties high enough to place them, or their author, in the rank they receive from the French : the prints which you have Seen, give a more exact idea-of theSe paintings than is possible for my pen. The hotels of the noblesse have Some very valuable paintings. The 3	Duke

IN Speaking of the diversions of Paris, I shall begin with the opera ; of which the French boast much, with little res-Son. The Coup D’ceil, is certainly very sine ; all the advantages that can be derived from machinery and decorations are criven to this entertainmient: but Sure music should, at least, make a part of the merit of an opera; and I am certain a perSon must have French ears, or none, who can receive pleaSure F 2	^ from
[ 63 J
from this performance at Paris. Castor and Pollux, is esteemed, by the French,, one of their best compositions, in which what should be music is noiSe, and the singing extravagant Screams. Tlie dancing, I acknowledge very sine, that it is the forte of the opera they are very Sensible, as may be Seen from the great ufe they make of it. Gods and devils, men and women, on every occasion composing a ball. Some defcendi-ing, others arising,, for this grand pur- j poSe: in short, the Sun and moon dan- | cing a minuet, would be no burleSque here; on the contrary, they would meet wdth high applauSe; and if,, by their infiuence, the stars could be pershade^d to step dov/n, and form a little cottih Ion, the whole houSe would be in raptures.

[ '69 1
Cons at this performance : though I have not been in that musical nation, I will affirm, none but a vitiated ear can pjreSer the French to the Italian music. Rousseau obServes, performing a piece of the composition of each nation before a Savage, the-pleaSure he will demonstrate from hearing the Italian, and pain from the French, are strong declarations of nature, in favor of the former. Without callino- in the Sava-.ges (vrhom a little afraid to trust from their known love of noiSe) the judg- ’ ment of every polished nation (except their own) is decisive enough against the Frenclu To allow all the meric that can be given them, they have great execution; and it must be this excellence which has inclined Some of tny countrymen to Speak in favor of ‘	F 3	French

I believe I shall not be singular in declaring (on the contrary, it is almost too general a Sentiment to write) expression is what I principally Seek m music, and every other Science where it can possibly enter : it is the great talent of the Italians, whenever they do not chuSe rather to raife wonder than give delight. The only fort of music I hear with pleasure in France, is the little Vaudevilles, or ballads, Sung at table ; and in theSe the ladies particularly excel, by the Spirit and expreshon with which they embellish them ; though I cannot fay the Subjedts are always adapted to a female performer, as they are Sometimes inconsistent with that delicacy and modesty wdsich is the ornament of your Sex,

I AM very happy when I can give applaufe to the talents of a nation against whom we are SuppoSed to be prejudiced : the highest is due to what I call the French Theatre, from its Superiority : the merit of their authors is known to you ; that of their actors is adequate to the greatest. We liave, sin England, Som.e performers who cannot be excelled ; but thoSe who
play
[ 73 ]
play the Second roles, are frequently very indifferent : here every part is equally Sustained. I have Seen the Me-rope, and Semiramis of Voltaire; which I think pieces of great merit ; they have exquisite strokes of nature, and what does not always happen in theatrical compositions, the moral is sine, and particularly adapted to the nation for whom it is wrote ; where, from the dissipated humor of the people, as well as the relief given by the Roman Catholic, remorSe for a wicked adion may Sometimes wear off too Soon, The French do not esteem Voltaire’s plays the best of his works: they are not thoSe which require, nor demonstrate most genius ; but I .think Some of them are more perfed than any thing he has, wrote, and have the highest of all me- ' rks; they may be uSeful, and cannot be

inisttious to mankind.----I have not
been So fortunate in the ‘comedies represented as tragedies : of the former,
• Le Legataire, by Renard, is one at which I was prefent: it has great hu-' mor, and the adtors rendered perfedl: justice to the Spirit of the author ; but I do not like the plan of the play : the hero, if the nephew is to be regarded in that light, is not rogue enough to give detestation ; yet far from being Sufficiently honest for imitation. If the < Servants are to be considered as a principal part, this circumstance alone, to .me, is an objedlion : the adlors are So .excellent in comedy and tragedy, it is difficult to fay in which they are Supe-jior : Mademoiffelle du MeSnil has great merit in the latter, and many dOthers who are her inferiors; but, upon the whole, I think pmedy has the p're-.
ference.

ference. The French have, in general, a Surprizing talent for repreSentadon ; they have great quickneSs of Sighti; the ' liveliness of their disposition inclines them to aftion ■ in common conversation : add to theSe qualifications, ha-1, ving rather a general than particular character, they, with much facility,, affume that proper to the occasion, and the perSonage they reprefent. I have before obferved, declamation is com-Hion to them all; I may likewiSe fay, a modest assurance.
The music of the petit opera is very pleasing ; but I cannot approve a piece joined to this entertainment, where -Harlequin is the hero and orator: his, v/it consists in blunders ; Such as Saying, he was shipwrecked contre un Ecureuil, instead of an Ecueil : all the grimace and humor with which he uttered this 3	Speech

Speech could not make me Smile,-though I had never heard it before ; but the whole houSe weresin the loudest laugh, to whom, I am perSuaded, it had not even the merit of novelty.

I once travelled with a party wsho' amuSed theraSelves two days in stealing a gentleman’s Snuff-box; every -repetition gave equal pleaSure, and wlten they Separated, the loSs of So much humor was mutually regretted;
5 would not be thought to infer from hence, this kingdom has not many I perSons of excellent Society ; I know it has, and their merit is greater from the difficulties with which it struggles and Surmounts. In general, the English ■excel the French in wit and humor, as much as in Soi-id Senie and learning ; as
may
[ 77 3
may be CaSily Seen from a cornparifon of the understandings of the people of each nation, who are a more just standard than their fuperiors ; their advantages beings more nearly equal, though fa? from being perfeftly sh. The bleshngs . of a free government, and the Protef* tant religion,, are too great and extensive for any one to judge of all their good and h’gh effeds, but by living fometime in a nation that does not eiv joy them. It Is Surprizing, to hear s Englishmen (as I have done) approve .and extol the Police of Paris ; a Police which, by the awe it strikes, fubdues the Spirit, and destroys the freedom of conversation, and almost that of thinking : I know it may be faid it only limits the mind on certain fubjeds; but are not they the most interesting in nature ^ and does not restraint on thefe wT-aken
the
[ 78 ]
the understanding for every other, except the Allard and opera fingers ? The preSent king has nothing to fear from freedom of Speech, or freedom of adlion in his fubjedts : in general he is excessively beloved, and the few who are discontented and capable of judging, fay, his good qualities are his own, his defedls thoSe of education, and the customs of his country ; from the only quarter he was in danger, the Police was of no uSe ; for it did not prevent the assassination in which the jeSuits were fuppofed to be concerned. I have heard a Police of this nature is requisite for the Security of the inhabitants ; but thofe who imagine there are leSs murders, or other crimes, in this city than London, are much mistaken, or I am misinformed : the custom of publishing every event in the papers, makes
us
r 79 ]
m appear more guilty than our neigtte hours, who are silent. However, let the Police employ as many Spies as they pleaSe for the detedliom of villains, in this pointit cannot be too industrious; but that an honest country gentleman,, •or any honest man should^ be. Subjedt to the Same inquisition,, is highly unreasonable. A perSon assuring me.

He is a man of Senfe, and. a man of Spirit, truly attached to the king ; but a. pique might have deprived him ot hit liberty. I have heard a general complaint it is dissicult to be introduced
to.
[ go ]
to the best company in Paris: with re- ' gard to certain coteries, no fashion, however great, is Sufficient ; as if once strangers were admitted, the freedom of conversation, for which they meet, would be destroyed. As for affem-blies in general, a very moderate recommendation will preSent any man who is a gentleman, and will play at cards; and if he will game, no other introduction is requisite, to the greatest and most brilliant company in Paris. La Bruyere’s observation, that the highest genius will not put a man upon a par with thoSe who can loSe a thousand pistoles upon a card, is quite as true, with regard to tlieSe assemblies, at this day, as when he wrote. As to the private coteries, in many there are no cards ; and a perSon rnuSr have wsit, or what passes with the company as Such,

LETTER XVI,
I DINED yesterday, in a French houfe, with Some Canadians-; from them I had the pleafure of hearing the highest and most honorable praiSes of m.y countrymen. It is unnecessary to observe, they were perSons of much un- , derstanding and generosity of Sentiment:
^ ' for thoSe qualities were abfolutely requisite to render justice to a conqiier-ing enemy, by whoSe bravery they had been great Sufferers; but every other idea was lost in thoSe of the humanity and politeneSs of their conquerors. I have heard a gentleman, who is a good judge, remark, the Canadians are, in general, myre intflligent than other
.French r
183 ]
French : as far as I am acquainted, the observation is just. A gentleman in company related an event, which demonstrates a man is in danger of loSino; his liberty in this kingdom, more from the pique or ignorance of inferior ma-’gistrates, than the court: it is true, with regard to the former there is generally redreSs ; but a few weeks con-stnement may Sometimes be of infinite 'Confequence. Permit me to give the relation, as I had it from the gentleman who was going ter the waters of Barege for his health. Far advanced in the South, as he was at mafs. Suddenly the church was Surrounded, and he taken prisoner, as an English Spy (it was in time of war): He desired leave to write to the court, or the colonel of the regiment where he was captain. Pen and sink were refuSed, his pockets Searched, G 2	every
[ 84 j ,
every thing of value Seized. Papers he had none. This confinement might, it is probable, have endured Some , months, but a lady came to the inn, where, for the preSent, he was confined : the hosteSs told the history, in which the lady found Something was wrong; being a woman "of Ipirit, she inSisted upon feeing the priSoner; and, as she was of high rank, the magistrates durst not refufe her ; she, upon entering the room, faw the gentleman was her countryman : indeed his figure is So truly French, and of what I have jieard shme dying English foldiers, at Fontenoy reproached their adverSaries, Soupe maigre. I do not conceive it possible to be Otherwise than a pique, and not a mistake. The lady commanded pen, ink, and paper, in conSe-quence of his letter, wshich the lady '	'	presented.
[ 85 ]
presented; orders came from the court, that the gentleman should demand whatever reparations he judged requisite. Though he had Suffered in many points, having lost Several things of value, besides the inconveniency of imprisonment ; yet, to shew he was not adluated by a Spirit of meer revenge, or interest, he alked nothing for himSelf, but releafe and reparations to Some poor Protestants, whom this magistrate had most cruelly oppresh The gentleman is now retired from the Service, with the Croix de St. Louis. I know him very well, and believe he is a man of honor and truth; and thofe who are not, are feldom falSe to the dishonor of their country, or countrymen. The king has, within a few years, made a very good order, with regard to thefe magistrates, who before were perfons of So G 3	low
( 86 3
low a rank, they could not be expedled to be guided by any other motive than interest. In anSwer to your question, how I like the ladies ^ I will tell you ; here are Sbme in this kingdom very pretty and agreeable; but the Parisians are not efteemed, by perSons of their own nation, handSome or well made. The defedl:, in general, of French faces, is aSameneSs ; 'the variety ojFcharacter. So striking in English beauties, is unknown here. Un air hardi, derived from much pains, and an idea that modesty and timidity beSpeak a perSon of mean birth, gives Such a general re-Semblance, if you go to an assembly, where there are two hundred women, every one appears of the Same family. They are all lively, or affedt that air, which is esteemed So requisite to beauty ; I have heard a woman laugh, when
I havQ
187 ]
1 have Seen her cry. Nature, no doubt," gives to the French as great variety of charadler as other nations; but the part of good breeding, stiled, presenting well, is begun when they are in-- fants, and purSued with Such assiduity, a child’s countenance, at six years old, is as formed, and can make as many grimaces (for politeneSs and affability can be esteemed no better at that age) as the most excellent in this art at thirty in England. I have heard a boy, before he had the habit of a man, tell every woman in the room she was belle cohime I’amour. A lad of fashion complaining, the manner of wearing his hair was infupportable, I adviSed him to wear it short. Ah I monsieur. Said he, Je ferois bien aiSe de le faire, mais on diroit que je n’avois ne Sentiment ni honneur, si a mon age je ne G 4	mettois
[ 88 ]
mettois pas de Pappillotes.—This Sentimental perSon was fifteen ; had never been out of his mother’s or nurSe’s ' houfe, nor had any education, except a little bad Latin, which he catched as he could from an old abbot (his tutor in partibus) when the weather was bad ; for when it was fine, he declared he did not love study. I am far from representing this as a general plan of French education; neither have I any reafon to think it very singular : his mother was esteemed a woman d’efprit, et beau-coup de fcavoir vivre. In an hotel where I once lodged, obServing a perfon who appeared So low as a sharper, I was afraid he should rob me. Upon informing mySelf, he proved, the tutor and governor of a fine young man of quality and fortune; he had a penSion of two hundred livres: I ani certain the valet de
chambre,
[ Sg ]
chambre, by his appearance, had a better appointment. I have heard a gentleman, who is very partial to his country, avow, many a man would give fifty louis a year to a book, who would not make this expence in the education of his children. You have read frequent exclamations against the English, by our writers, with regard to luxury, and want of domestic attention ; but, thank God, Such unnatural and abfurd Sentiments, as related above, are unknown in England : a Small refidence in this country, past in the examination of manners, will convince how much, in general, we Spend our money better than our neighbours. Now I am upon the Subject of education, I will Speak a few words upon that of girls, who are of the common rank of noblesse. They are Sent to a convent,
in
[ 9° ]
in a provincial town; where, for a Small pension, they are kept alive, rather than fed. The learning is. Some religion, and much Superstition, working, and Screaming to music ; instrumental being more expensive, is not So general. The principal instrudtion of theSe young ladies is, to read, and hear read the lives of the faints; upon which, in Some convents, they declame ; thoSe who can determine with the greatest -precision, whether St. Catherine, or ,St. Bridget, &c. had the greatest merit, gain the palm.—This brings to my remembrance an examination which passed before the great and celebrated pope Lambertini; the future bishop was ashed, as a knotty point of divinity,. whether the FranciScans, or Bc-nedidlines, or Some other order, no matter wshoSe, was the most ancient.^’ The
ex ami-
[ 91 ]
examiners were going on in this style, when the pope interrupted them, with-an ironical air. Saying, thoSe were points of too much conSequence to be decided in haste ; therefore desired they might be left to the generals of their respective orders, who could write more volumes upon the Subject than he had hours to Spare. As I know you are an enemy to flattery, and as I ami the Same,
I will not SuppoSe your time equally precious with that celebrated pontiff’s; consequently shall make no apology for having Spoke on Subjests vrhich appear So trivial. 1 am happy when I can write any thing that deServes your attention : though permit me to Say, I receive more pleaSure from the idea of your partiality, than I could from the greatest advantages, or even Superiority of taleHts, in the poffcssion of '
w'hich.

LETTER XVII.
I HAVE been at Verfailles, a place ' So -well known it is Scarce possible to Say any thing new ; for that reaSon I shall not dwell upon the Subjedl. The facade of the palace to the town, has rather the appearance of a heap of buildings, than the front of one large edifice ; that to the gardens is very handSome : the apartments are extremely Spacious and noble. I was Sorry I had not thne to examine the paintings.
I 93 ]
ings So much as I wished. The king passing to hear maSs, I was led by my company to make his Suite. This ceremony is more pleasing at VerSaillp, than any other place where I have attended ; as the Service is short, and the music. Sung by an Italian, very fine : at other churches or chapels, they have only music at the grand maSs, which is too long; for thoSe wsho have no other motive than curiosity. Whenever I am preSent at this ceremony, it is with regret I oblerve an appearance of Such confined Sentiments in Christians, and, in opposition to them, refiefl upon thoSe Sublime ideas, which Lucan gives to Cato : Ideas perfectly agreeable to Christianity,
Estque Dei fedes, iibi terra, et pontus et aer Et coelum, et virtus-----------
Where earth, (ea, air, or heaven Is,
God reigns ; and virtue is his throne.

It is certain many perSons, of Supe* rior understanding and Sentiments, who are Catholics by profession, do not believe every point taught by the churcM of Rome^ A lady accusing a gentle^ man of my acquaintance of not being a good Catholic; he replied. It is true, madam, there may be many better in this city ; but I should be Sorry if this nation, or any other, could boast a more honest man : That he was what he indire<5Uy asserted, in the unlimited Senfe of the words, was So notorious, the pride of the Speech was lost in its veracity. The chapel ofVerSailles is very fine and pretty ; but this is by no ■means the just praiSe of a building dedicated to the divinity which ought to be in a more Solemn and Sublime style. The celebrated gardens did not anSwer my expeDations, my ideas were raiSed too high ; it is common to hear of I	Scenes
[ 95 ]
shenes more beautiful than the imiagina-tion, but they exist not in the works o]f art. A lively imagination paints stronger, and finer, than any human power can execute; he alone who formed that faculty, can furpaSs it. Here are Some good statues,^ and the principal waterworks are worth feeing: thoSe in the labyrinth are So trifling, I should not have given them a moment’s attention, but for the pleafure of observing a child of four years old explain the figures which were perfedUy adapted to his age and understanding. TheSe gardens, though large, appear contrafted, as their situ-' ation does not permit a view beyond fliem. In general, the EngliSn much SurpaSs the French in this point. A genius for the great and natural, which is distinguiSliable in many of our writers, is never more requisite than when
we
[96]
w'e are forming rural Scenes ; as in thoSe art should hide her head, and nature alone appear: corredlneSs and exactitude, the great merit of the French authors, has nothing to do here. There is another reaSon why the English should SurpaSs this nation in theSe undertakings ; the former often delight in a country life; reading and meditation are the voluntary occupations of my countrymen. Scarce ever of the French; the Smallest bourg is to them preferable to the finest feat. I have been told, many of the monks de Char-treux, wshoSe powers of Ipeech are limited, turn mad ; it is generally imputed to this cauSe : but as the Same misfortune happens in convents of women, the most probable reaSon is the general diSagreeableneSs of the situ^ tion. How far the latter are from
keepi
[ 97 ]
keeping,Silence every one knows who has visited thoSe houfes, and from their general reputation on that head. '' GreS-fet, with great humor, repreSents the foul of a parrot transmigrated into a nun. Whatever is the cauSe, madneSs, in every situation of life, is more common than in England ; which is very astonishing, when one conSiders how weak their Sentiments are of bvery kind; but very accountable from the strength of their passions, which, for want of. refiedbion, knows no bounds; the word Sentiment is ever in their mouth, but never in their hearts, or, if k isj haiff applied. It is unneceffary to oblerve here, as in many other .places, I {peak in general terms. 1 'will, in my next, give a relation where, though you will See much passion (and of a kind not very common in France) yet I. think VoL, L	H	you
( 98 1
you will allow Some Sentiment. 1 ami happy to Say, I should be more So to demonstrate, the regard with which I am.

LETTER XVIII.
T H E following anecdote I had from a gentleman of veracity, as a fatst, that passed not many years since. A man of quality obServing his wife agreeable to* a certain great perSonage, and ^ apprehending she might have the fame loyal Sentiments as a lady with whom I conversed the other day, Nos corps, et nos biens Sont au roi, in which she would have had a considerable ma-'	'	•	' ■	■ jority

jority on her side ; but her hushand being strongly in the minority, went into her apartment one morning, and declared his Sentiments in the following terms, with two pistols in his hands : Madam, I have too high a regard for your and my honor, and too fond an attachment to your perSon, to yield either to any power on earth, if you will not agree to take the proper steps to Secure them, this pistol shall: As I neither expedt to eScape, nor wish to Survive Such an adllon, and the loSs of you a moment, here is another for mySelf.—The tragedy did not end very deeply : the lady Seeing her hushand in earnest, immediately went with him into the country, and was never enquired aftershy her royal lover; who always prefers thoSe who court, to them
that fiy.^--I went yesterday to the
H 2	Bois
[ too t
i^ois de Boulogne,, which is particularly agreeable from its vicinity ‘to Paris, as ■ that Situation renders one perfectly Sensible to all its rural charms.. The Chateau de Madrid pleaSes from novelty it was built by Francis the'first, to imitate as well by the interior disposition of thcapartments, as by the architecture 'and outward ornaments, the Chateau, de Madrid,, where he was kept prisoner by Charles, the fifth; how he came, there you are So good an historian. It. is. not necessary for me to relate. What. couM induce the monarch to ereD a palace in commemoration of sticst a. disagreeable event,, I will not pretend to., determine., It is Said the imitation is exaCl as his wishes, even to the little guard-room. The proSpeCt from the Chateau is very fine. It is now in. poffeshon of the prefident de Pelletier.
There

iTherc is nothing worthy remark but Some goodj pictures of perSons of dir •stin^ion iri the robe, many of theru relations of the president, and a piece '.of the famous Duke de Sully, ^ the high merit and reputation of the origi-mal gives great worth to every reprcr fentation. Near the Bois de Boulogne is the village of Pasty, the most pleafant in France. The gardens, where are the medicinal waters, command a charming proSpedt of the Seine, P^ris, and the environs. I have made Several es-oursions ; but if I find Some pleaSure m feeing a number of palaces, •! am apprehensive there is too much SameneSs for ypu to receive any from the description ; for this reafon I will only fay of St. Cloud, it is, in my opinion, preferable to Verfailles; as I think situation more confeqpendal than ma^nisi-H 3	cence^

cence. Louis Quatorze liked this palace too well; he told his brother, he wished to be his Concierge ; a hint the Duke of Orleans did not chuSe to take. It is amazing, amidst So many fine situations, what could induce that monarch to fix upon one So bad as Versailles to display his magnificence; Some Say it was to render the power of the latter more conSpicuous. The fame expence at St. Germains would have made that place one of the finest in the vmrld. I have heard, the view of St. Denis from thence deterred the king from building, and improving St. Germains. He could take no pleasure in a proSpedl; of which his Memento rriori made a part. This may not be the true reaSon, but appears pof-Sible to thofe who are well acquainted with the French. Their fears and apprehensions
I 103 ]
prehensions of death are most excessive. An elderly lady invited me, with many others, to her tete, which they celebrate on the day of the patron Saint; from whom they take their name as we do a birth-day : I wished that lady numerous and happy years ; she made no anSwer, a cloud came over her face, of which I did not comprehend the reaSon ; but was afterwards told, my wish implied a possibility of the contrary, and had by that means shocked her. I have known perfons who appeared to believe all the legends Superstition can teach; yet, upon a strid conversation, they did not diScover t|ie least reasonable hope or faith of an immortal life, A Sentiment which Fielding gives to Sophia's maid in raillery, I have heard many French ferioufiy avow, particularly the ladies. It is better to kill all H 4	the
[ i°4 ]
the world than one’s felf: they gavp this as _ a, Catholic principle, and ar-^ gued, penitence was left for the one, and not the other. It is certain w0 have no right to diSpoSe of our own lives; but, if possible, I think we have JeSs to diSpoSe of another perfon’s. It js^ not only in this, but rnany other points, they ch\iSe to depend upon penance and absolution ; I fuppoSe, as being much easier than constant and unifonn virtue, I propofe to qtjit this place torinorrow, which I shall do withopt the least regret ; as every re-niove, though jt apparently carries me from you, will hasten our meeting. In-‘ deed your abfence rnakes a void in life, which all the pleaSiires,. beauties, and agreement, to be found in this world, cannot filf up. So reasonable a hap-pineSs^ and So high a Satisfaestion, as
that

I HAVE been about ten days , ait Bfois : the inhabitants appear a very .Sq^ ciabk, agreeable people, extremely ci-vih to strangers ; particularly Madame de‘Baillehache, one of the first perfons, (though here is much ancient noblesse); being English is the highest introducr tion to her Society. ' A great nurnber of Canadians live in this city; I _am
acquainted
[ io6 ]
acquainted with none except the ladies pf the Vaffint family ; who are very Sensible agreeable women, of a good houSe in Bretagne. Blois is celebrated for Speaking the best French in the kingdom : Some aff:rt this reputation was acquired from the residence of the court; consequently has no longer a right to that Superiority. If people mean by the best French, the best accent, not only Blois, but all the country d’alentour, has the fame merit. If the richneSs of the language is to be taken into the excellence, I should think University or Parliament towns, being feats of eloquence, have more just pretensions.. I know Some of the j latter, particularly Rouen, have a bad accent; but it does not affehl the rank of people whom strangers frequent,. ThoSe. who compoSe the best focicsies,
as
[ 107 ]
as the houSe robe, principal clergy, &c. are educated in Paris, the latter at the Sorbonne. Hear the one Speak, and the other preach, I defy the nicest ear to discover the Rouennois in their elegant diScourSes : what. I know of this, I imagine of the other Seats of parliament, particularly of Bretagne; where, from the Spirit of eloquence which didlated their remonstrances, may be Seen how highly they poffeSs their language ; and wherever the robe are distinguished, the Same degree of excellence may be expected from the clergy, talents increasing by emula^ tion. It is true, the liberty of parlia^ ments, and the abSolute power of the l(oman church, are Subjedls which form a contrast ; accordingly the parties are always at variance ; but gracer-ful elocution, and just diDion, are
equally
I loS ]	j
'equally employed by both to carry theirpointB.—I have heard an anecdote; which at first Surprized me much; but upon refieDion, a<part of my astonishment ceaSed ; it is, that Madame de Se-vigne hated her daughter, to whom she wrote So many volumes of letters, full of the most tender affedlion. I can •conceive, a woman may want natural affedion, a child may not merit it, and •decency may oblige people to a certain appearance : but that it is possible to <ejtpreSs So much love v/here there is So little, I could never have believed, had not thoSe expressions been outrees : they appeared to me ridiculous before I lieard this anecdote, and now contemptible, The Sentiments and expressions <>f nature, may equal or SurpaSs in force thoSe of the passions, but never can have the ridicule which Sonaetimes attends
r 109 j
sends the latter ; and Sure, for a met-rher to compliment a daughter on her beauty, has So great a degree of folly, if she is not a fool (as Madame de Se-vigne certainly was not) it must proceed from Some extraordinary motive though disiike to a daughter, at least, if one may judge from the ill treatment of them, can Scarce be called So here.. Of the numbers of girlswlio are forced into convents, there are many morer from the cruelty of m.others than fathers. If Madame de Sevigne had the Understanding feme people give her, she was not only a general colitradiistion to the world, in general, but a particular one to the French with Wshom I am acquainted;, who are artful in the fame degree they are weak, and wish as they are sincere. It is lirtneGeffary to-fay this obServatiorv regards only common
t 110 ]
mon life; in politics I am not conversant ; there I fuppoSe all may deScend to art. If this anecdote is falSe, it comes from the French; who are, in general, interested in the reputation of their writers; and one would hope en^ vy nor Scandal could not live So long after the perfon it regards is dead. But in contrast to this defedl in family affection, which I cannot mySelf affirm, I will give the history of a domestic heroine (though in another kind) the truth of which I can aver. An officer, who had Served Several years with di-stisi'dlion and reputation. Sent to desire his wife to join him at Brest, to go to the West Indies, where his regiment was commanded; she immediately complied, though in a Situation which rendered Such a voyage dangerous. Imagine then her distreSs, when arriving at
1 Brest,
t III i
/ Brest, she found her hushand confined by a pique of his Colonel, and disho* nored, by being cashiered without the uSual reward of long. Service, the Croix de St. Louis ; the pension annexed is inconsiderable, but though the order is common, the high point of honor attached to it, is beyond the conception of an Englishman, at least, a wife one, who rests his reputation upon Somethihg more Solid than the court can give, or the pique of a courtier prevent. The lady conSulted the officers whom justice interested in the honor of her hushand : they adviSed, if possible, to get to VerSailles before the Colonel, who had that day Set out to have' his proceedings ratified ; after which they are Seldom changed or corr ^ reded. Finding no .chaiSe, the lady took post horSes, and purSued her jour-i	ney
t II2 1
nty with Such Spirit, night and day, she? presented her p(^tition to the DauphC ncSs ; it was granted, and she met the Colonel entering the palace of Versailles as she quitted it. I had the pleaSure of dining with this happy couple when the above-written event v/as related. It, is impossible to expreSs the Satisfaction and .ple-aSute vrhich appeared in the gentleman’s countenance, nor his fond-neSs for a wife and only child, whoSe lives had been riSqued for the Sole cauSe cn earth that could she put in competition with them : they have little more than a hundred a /year: love formed their Union. I could not but remark Such a singular instance of conjugal affection, 'in a nation where a moderate degree'df this virtue is rare. You Will not wonder it is fo, when I tell the •manner in which marriages, in general, 3	are
[ “3 ]
are contraDed. The gentleman pays a visit to the lady, who is at the other side of the grate ; in that Situation every man is charming : it Saves the exertion of paternal authority, and the assiduity of a lover. The conSequences of theSe unions are what might be expedt-ed; the lady efcaped from her Confinement, places her happineSs in repairing lost time, by living in public ; and her hushand, whom she could not be Said to chuSe, she Seldom approves. Compliments, which have only their just value with thoSe who have lived and been educated in the world, turn the brain, and make the bliSs of a perSon to whom they are entirely new. The honor of a deliberate distinction is, I flatter mySelf, that of, Madam^
Blots. Your most obedient, &c.

LETTER XX.-
O N the road from Blois to Orleans,., is the charming feat of. Madame de Pompadour’s brother, now Monsi de Menard, from the name of this Chateau. The fashion of taking the title, of an estate, v/hich the French do, whether it comes by inheritance or pur-chafe, makes them change their appellations three or four times in their lives.
This custom confuSed me extremely ' »
when I. first came into France; for I imagined every perfon of the family whoSe name was their distindlion. Seeing a Mademoiselle de Courtenay, I concluded she was of that houSe, one of. the firSc in France ; but I found she was only called So from a little piece off
ground,,
[•15]	'

The great, from their different estates, are easily Supplied with distindlions ; but I have known thoSe who were poor, and of inferior rank, and yet would ape them ; obliged to a gooleberiy-bush, or a cherry-tree, for their title. Orleans is a large tov/n, but very little good company. The ca- ' thedral is very handfome, to which considerable additions are making, a great Sum being appropriated to that uSe. The bridge lately built is very fine, but not equal to Westminster. The French are very fond of a Bon mot Said with regard to this edifice. A perSon finding it, as he thought, very defedtive in point of strength, and declaring his opinion, was anSwered, Cela I 2	n’est

n’cst pas vrai, car il a foutena le plus grand poids de la France, Madame de Pompadour est paffee parla hier. The Rue Royale, which leads to the bridge, is very handSome : the fronts of the houSes are built by the king, any per-Son may buy one, and finish the remainder of the dwelling to his taste. This uniformity has a beautiful effedl, the facades being compleat to the bridge, which leading to the planted road makes the point of view perfedly fine. In the chapel of the Benedidlins, there are what the people call paintings, but they really do not deServe that title. The tapestry has much better pretenSions from the appearance; one must go very near to be undeceived. The Bene-didlins are esteemed an order who have Some learning, particularly in history ; but a Monkish history is generally too
partial

partial to be very valuable. However, nothing can be Said againSt this order in particular, except their poffeffing great ' riches, which m.ight be employed to better purpoSes. It is certainly very unjust, perSons who are a dead weight upon the public, should have more wealth than they can find means to Spend; when an officer, who has ventured his life for the Service of his king and country, as well as Spent the little fortune he received from his family, has only four hundred livres a year, about Seventeen or eighteen pounds sterling: I know Some who have but this penSion for their Support, and perSons of very good family.------1 was

As to Racine, his style is eaSy, and his charaders being ancient, foreign, and, in general, tragic, are as well known to us as the French : They generally prefer Racine to Corneille ; in which, as in many points, I differ from them.

The gentry are much distressed ; but the most shocking sio-ht I ever Saw in this reSpeD, was a gentleman travelling in la Beauce, walking with his wife, who was barefooted : he had, as they called it, deroged, by marrying his Servant; yet, as by his figure no Superiority appeared, except that derived from his Sword, ssioes and stockings, in which he could not make her his equal, I do not Sec there was any great harm done ; for I imagine they were upon a par as to Sentiments, the most eSfential point in Such an union ; he having been born to this exceSs of
poverty
[ '25 ]
poverty it was not possible he could have received a common French education ; as long as a family can be brought up with any degree of decency and knowledge, a man does right to keep the advantages of noblesse; a moderate fortune gained in trade, beino-far from compensating what may be lost in rendering "Sons incapable of the many lucrative honors attached to high birth, and daughters of great alliances.
I am acquainted with a man of quality and vast fortune, who, going to make a residence at an estate he had never Seen, called upon ar\old friend of his ' father’s ; when entering the court, he was fo highly struck and charmed with the beauty of a young woman who was washing, that, in a moment, he was defperately in love ; as he approached, she ran away : this circumstance, and •	a know-
[ 126 ]
a knowledge of the gentleman’s pcver-* ty, made him hope it was the daughter cf a friend ; he was not mistaken, and married her without the least hesitation * which he would not have done the greatest fortune who had net the Sam.e birth : As for education, it v/as probably better than if her parents had been more at their eaSe ; for, in general, amongst the women I have known, thoSe arc most agreeable who have been educated at home. A gentleman, the eldest of ten children, told me, they entered the world with no other advantage than a good name. They are all very considerable at preSent. I do not ’ fay theSe events are frequent, but enough So to prove we should not wonder (as I have heard Some English) and blame the French noblesse, becaufe tliey do not engage in trade upon the
least
C Ii27 1
least glimpSe of poverty. What is right,, and perhaps requiSite in one System of government, may be wrong in another. It is most certain, before they arrive at the degree of miSery with the poor gentleman I first mentioned, they would do well to quit that state from vrhich they can receive no advantage; not being in a Situation to affociate with their Superiors, they have no chance of raising,; their fortune. What is a much greater inconvenience to the nation than the noblesse not enterino* into commerce, thoSe who are in that situation will not continue a moment after they can live idle. A Bourgeois being a step above a Merchant, by this means busineSs is never well understood, nor carried on with any advantage. Many Engsish have an idea none but gentlemen are-adqiitted into the army ; yet not only 3,

The lervice has every advantage but riches ; even the lowest Soldier finds a Superior proteDion from the court; of which, the following circumstances are a proof.
A Protestant Soldier died ; the commanding officer ordered him to be buried ; the priest refuSed to do his duty ; a guard was Set about the grave, the man put into it, and. the priest commanded to let him rest till an anSwer , came from court : the order arrived,

The Cour de Berci is esteemed the finest in France ; it is very large, and beautifully planted ; but I think the Cour at Rouen more pleasing, as there is a greater variety in the view. In the convent of St. Mary is a Superb monument of the last Duke of Mont-morenci, who was beheaded at Thou-loufe in the reign of Louis Treize. When at a distance from the capital, nothing efcapes that merits attention. ThoSe I have mentioned are the only obje<51:s which deServe to interrupt a

TheSe pleasing proSpedls, added to a Society well compoSed, have rendered my journey very agreeable. The French are, in general, good travelling companions ; Soon acquainted, and have p. knowledge uSeful for the occasion ; hiS-tories of families, provinces, &c.

Sequential; but, in general, no more is to be Said of one woman the King loves than of another. I have related one affair as it was attended with particular circumstances, the Same reaSon engages me in the following. Perhaps it may be necessary to premiSe, though (to the honor of the court) lettres de cachets are not So easily obtained as they were Sometime since ; yet, at preSent, by them perSons may be confined, without trial, not only on ministerial affairs, but by their relations, and are So on various Subjedls and pretences. A lady had shut up her father in one of theSe MaiSons de Force ; Sometime after the King happened to take a fancy to her: A perSon, who did not chooSe she should have So high a rank as the King’s mai-treffe en titre is here esteemed, told him t)f the above-mentioned affair, which K 3	had
.[ 134 ]
had the desired effect; his Majesty never afterwards treating her with any distindion. Odd enough, that virtue of any kind should be requisite for Such a situation. Perhaps a more effectual method could not be taken to encourage filial piety ; of which, and every family Sentiment, prance appears to have leSs than England ; but the royal houSe is, in general, distinguished for this merit. The King was many years a very attached and fond hushand. ,What must be the strength and blind-neSs of that passion which made him fay, whenever a handfome woman was mentioned. Is she as handfome as my Queen ? who is, without exception, the plainest perSon in Europe. This Sentiment continued So long, it would probably have been as lasting as life, had not the Qlieen’s mistaken devotions
rendered

Tendered her incapable of entertaining him ; his Majesty must be entertained, and does not diflike being governed. The Queen had as little inclination for government as the Kin^; she threw herSelf into the hands of the priests ; he fell into thofc of a mistreSs. You will, perhaps, think I have wandered from the Subjedl of the King’s amours >; pardon me, however unufual a circum-, stance it may be in this kingdom, there is reafon to -think he never loved any woman but his Wife ; though, by the assiduity of others, he-is connedled with them, as tlie Queen preferred her devotions to his Majesty’s Society, Coffee is her passion, though she likes the pleasures of the table In general; having once, as a penance, ceaSed to drink that liquor, she was So miserable, as to be obliged to desist from a Scheme K 4	which

The situation of Lyons is extremely beautiful and advantageous. The
rivers
[ 137 ]
rivers Soane and Rhone are great ornaments, and contribute to render it the most rich and commercial city in France. This place Supplies with ma-nufadlures not only the whole kingdom, but Italy and Spain ; the latter have their dresses, as well as silks, made here. The place de Bel cour Surpasses, in many reSpedls, any in Paris, except that of Louis C^inze : this place has a beautiful shady walk, and though , in the midst of the town, has a view into the country : The hills, covered with the rich fruits of this province, rising into an amphitheatre above the tops of the houfes, have a most plea-fing effedt. The quay is very hand-Some, the ramparts are an agreeable walk, and command a fine profpedf. You fee the situation of the town is charming; but I should never chooSe a
long
t 138']
long Tefidence in Lyons, the Society being fiir from desirable. The inhabitants are almost all des gens parvenus ; very little true noblesse. It is very eaSy, wshen riches are acquired, to pur-chaSe offices which give the rank of 'gentlemen; but the Sentiments by which they are distinguished, are beyond all price. Honor and politeneSs are the general attendants on hish birtli; how far others may be inferior to thoSe who have this advantage in the first of theSe qualities, my acquaintance with the gentilhomme Bourgeois, is too ssight to determine with justice ; but a day is Sufficient to See in the latter
they bear no comparison.-----This city
has a good theatre, concerts, &c. The women have very little beauty, but endeavour to Supply that defedl by drefs, which, in general. Succeeds with
French-
[ 139 ]
Frenchmen; une belle femme, et une femme bien miSe, being almost Synonymous terms. The Duke de Villeroi is governor of this town, but Seldom resident. The intendant and commandant receive company. The com-manderie is joined to the prevot des mar-chands; consequently the commandants are of a rank inferior to thoSe in other cities. A gentleman of my acquaintance observing a perSon in that office, who had but an indifferent appearance, aSked if he was of condition. The perSon he addressed, anSwered, II est un gentilhomme comme cela. I think none should be deSpiSed for their birth, but thoSe who are inSolent from their riches ; a defedl very general in all the French wsho acquire fortunes by commerce: In England, the fucceSs beLng more common, is Supported with a better 3	graccw

grace. The inhabitants cf Lyons are not So ignorant as in Some parts of France; they would not be SurpriSed to hear the children in Rome Speak Italian, as v/as one of their countrymen, who being . anSwered, Do not children in France Speak French ^ Said, Perdie, parle Francois, tout le monde parle Francois. The great commerce of this city obliges the Lyonnois to be connedled, and Sometimes to travel into foreign countries ; which gives a great Superiority to many provincial towns, and, being the route to Italy, brings many strangers. At a Supper where I was preSent, added to Several very intelligent perSons of this place, there were two Italians of high fashion and agreeable Society. The perSons one meets abroad are geherally Superior to thoSe at hopie; as it is that Superiority which gives an
inch-

inclination for farther knowledge. Ir is only the English, who frequently visit foreign nations without any other motive than fashion. The upper rank of people in Lyons, keep very great and elegant tables, Surpassing any I have yet Seen in a provincial town. Wine and all provisions, are in equal abundance and perfedtion. One cir-» cumstance, in the manner of living in this city, is very low and mean : Persons of great fortune let out different parts of the houfes they inhabit : I am in that of a gentleman who makes a considerable figure ; here are three or four families, besides the perSon of whom I hire my part. A French gentleman, who thinks he understands English, and the customs of the nation, shewed me a lady at the play, and pointing to her with great derision. Said
she

she was quite a toast; what he understood by that word, I cannot better explain to you than in faying, it regarded her character (not her perSon); which was the reverSe of hers, to whom I have the honor of being

people of birth and education, though distressed fortune, their mcdeSty, So far from preventing, leads them to a retirement, where not many will Seek their ^ merit to reward it : theSe were the lady’s observations.

Sometimes Send their children to starve in a convent; but they starve a la FrancoiSe. Mr. Locke thought too much was riSqued to accomplish men’in the finest languages: What would he have Said where the rilqiie is So much greater, and the acquisition So much leSs. I grant the languages are ornaments, v/hen they can be acquired without any hazard of effential qualifications. A woman may not only fill every duty in VoL. I.	L	life

daring, as the King, when a lady v/as presented, whoSe beauty was her greatest excellence, C’est une belle bete. His Majesty is not celebrated for genius ; but he is a Frenchman, consequently, wit, or what amuSes as Such, is by him preferred to beauty. I do not agree with this nation in the extraordinary homage they pay to a brilliant understanding, as I think great efforts to shine in this light frequently deStroys more essential merits, particularly in your Sex, Madam. Modesty and good nature may render a woman happy, and all thoSe who are conneDed with her; but every other quality combined, cannot compenSate a deficiency in thefe. Do not imagine what I have Said proceeds from a desire of limiting the tinderstanding of women ; no, I only vrish them, to aequ-ire~'true knowledge, in L 2	which

which every advancement is a progrefe towards virtue, vice proceeding frequently from ignorance. If people could be convinced virtue would make them more happy than vice, which is a certain truth, and that every deviation from the former, is a step to miSery, none could purSue the latter. Virtue is the first requisite to happineSs, but to ' Say
Virtue alone makes happineSs below,
cannot be true, unlds it was univerSal; in the preSent state of the world, it is talking to children, and to them improperly ; becauSe it is not exadl truth .: Lxperience will convince this dodtrine is in Some degree falSe ; from thence they may judge it is entirely So.

It will be much for the public good if the preSent King should reign many years longer ; he, the parliament, and court in general, are inclined to weaken the power of the clergy; but they, by their influence over the people, oblige their adversaries to take almost imperceptible steps to carry the point in view.

love might very well make a principal adion ; it was natural to that prince’s Situation, and age, as advanced by Racine. The following lines are exp ref-five, just, and natural, when Nero queftions Narcissus, Whether he really thinks the young prince loves ? the ' courtier anSwers like a perSon accustomed, as he was, to obServe and study the countenances, and from thence judge the diSpofitions of mankind :

In the ficate of Britannicus love alone could produce the effedl So well described, and in So few w^ords, a merit which is not often Racine’s, his SenSe' being frequently finished before the line. This piece, and Some others,
' 'are So good upon the whole, it would be unpardonable to Seek for little defers, which, perhaps, are unavoidable in numerous compositions.

F ROM Lyons we dined at Con-drieu ; where I think we had the most
t
excellent and cheapest repast I ever yet beheld ; the advantages of the country are, in this reSpecst, lost, when English travel alone. Our own party consisted of two Ens;lish and three French ; to which we added three or four more for the dining company. A bill of fare is not, ■very amusing; but this was So extraor?- ‘ Vot. II.

dlnary, I should give it if my memory would permit ; as it will not, I shall only fay, in the Service of Roti, we had all kinds of fowls, game, and birds ; amongst the latter were ortolans, and a kind, peculiar to the country, prefer- • able to ortolans. We had the wine of this place, which pleaSes me beyer than any other in France. Two ladies, who had drank none of that liquor since they left Paris, were content with le vin de Condrieux. We paid but eighteen pence a head English money, and the gentleman who managed our affairs. Said at the table d’hote, with the Same fare they were still cheaper.— The rapidity of the Rhone is So notorious, any remarks I could make on that head v/ould be too trite to dej-Serve reading. When the boat passed

This edifice has nothing extraordinary, but great length, to which the breadth bears no proportion ; nor has it any beauty, except what is derived from the idea of its utility. The rapidity of the river might occasion Some difficulties ; yet, as they have been shrmounted in So many different places, one cannot make them the shbjed of wonder. We had , B 2	what
[ 4 ]
what they Called a bad voyage : an English gentleman feeing the Sailor^ aukward, expressed his wishes for two or three British.' A Frenchman',) half angry half complimenting. Said, you are better without them,, Sir ; they would know, and tell the danger you are in, of which you are not perfectly LnSible, or your countenance would not be fa compoSed : We acknowledge your Superiority in thefe affairs, and your merit in many others ; but deSire you will allow Some to your neighboursthough k is not on this occasioa we shall make any claim.

I cannot tell which ; a gentleman and his wife, who directed our journey from Briare, choSe this method of going to Avignon, as being the most expeditious and -cheapest; it proved the re-
verSe.----The approach to Avignoft
is very beautiful, the town is Small, the ramparts are singularly handfoshc. This city is the reSort of much ancient nobleffe, whoSe fortunes are not large enough to make Paris their winter residence. I know Scarce any provincial town where there are So many fine hotels,. The Society, Ham told, is very good. This city being the Pope’s, is full of convents and clergy, who make more beggars than the benevolence of the bishops can ashst, though very great. The charity of the Roman Catholic religion is like breaking a man’s leg, B 3	and
[6]
and. then relieving the conSequent diS-treSs. The Penitens Gris have a chapel here ; .which pleaSes mie more than any thing of the Same kind I ever beheld. The building has three divisions, o;oing through two chapels to the principal; where is the perpetual adoration du Saint Sacrament. The manner in which the altar is Illuminated and decorated, has Something more imposing, and strikingly Solemn, than can be conceived : It is impossible to enter this edifice without a certain degree of reve-. rence. The whole building, though •very Small, is perfectly well adapted to its uSe. A poor old man was prostrate before the altar, performing with great zeal the mistaken duties of the place. The Catholics assert, they haye the Same right to the profession of their re-I	ligion.

ligion in Protestant, as the Reformed in Catholic Countries: To the private enjoyment and exerciSe they certainly have, but the public being So imposing, Speaking to the SenSes, and not to reaSon ; it would be very improper to expoSe the common people to Such a Sedudlion, and the Specious arguments of the clergy. The procession of ■the feast du Saint Sacrament, is very Splendid and striking in large towns, where there is a cathedral, and the religious orders very numerous. I once read an advertisement on that occasion, w'hich appeared very extraordinary :
“ The angels are desired to attend “ precisely at six o’clock.’*
To explain this, children are dressed according to the French idea of angels, B 4	with
[ 8 ]
wsith much riband, gold, silver, &c. and walk to heighten the dignity of the procession. , You have only to fee the feast of St. Nicolas, and ceaSe wondering the people are So much attached to a religion which gives them, in Some dioceSes, sixty or Seventy days of mirth, music and dancing, besides Sunday; where the bishops are So wiSe as to abridge their holidays, that their children may have bread ; every storm which blast the vines, or other public ill, is imputed to his defedl in veneration for the Saints. Some company called upon me this afternoon, to go with them to fee the DutcheSs de Cril-lon’s hotel (as to the Duke, I Scarce ever heard him mentioned); it is a fine houSe, shut has nothing singular enough to deServe a visit : in the hall is a large pi(5ture3, an original, in wliich

In the apartment of the DutcheSs is a Magdalen much esteemed, by Guido; in ano^ ther is a pidure of MademoiSelle de Crillon, who is extremely pretty, but has taken the veil in the Severe order of the Carmelites, where they are not per-l	m,itte4!.

•	Son ; for a very Small part of what hap-. ' ■ pens in this kingdom can come within
the knowledge of a stranger, particularly of that kind. As to the young lady abovementioned, her state may be voluntary, for aught I can Say to the contrary : what is very odd, I have -heard the Severe orders are more fre-' -quently So than others. The famsily de Crillon did live in a very magnificent •style ; at preSent she has only the petit Souper, and receives none who are not particularly preSented. From this hotel

tel I went to See the chapel of Les Peres dc l.Dratoire, esteemed a fine piece of architcisturc ; it has, I think, nothing singular, except the figure, v/hich is a Small rotunda. Near this city is the celebrated fountain of VaucluSe ; where Petrarch Sang the praiSe of his charming Laura. Poets mistresses' have a great advantage and agrement, if they love admiration (and we have frequently Seen they are not in this, or any re-Spedl, Superior to other women) for not only the preSent, but that of future ages, is theirs.

Between Avignon and NiSmes I Saw a most extraordinary piece of architecture, Pont du gard. It is an. ancient work of the Romans, more curious than beautiful.. I can only tell you, there are three bridges, one upon another ; I have a print gives a better idea, which, you will lay, is very poS-fible. Nifmes has- Some fine antiqute ties ; an amphitheatre,. SuppoSed to be built about the time of Trajan; it is-esteemed in higher preservation tharr any now remaining. I cannot possibly" give Such a description of this edifice as it merits ; I never beheld any So pro-digiousty vast : from thence is derived^ the magnificence which attends this edi-.	. .	fice^
[ H 1
fee, for it is of the TuScan order. Here are fears for twenty thouSand people. The Goths have made their utmost efforts to destroy this noble monument of antiquity. Charlemagne gave the last great shock ; but there are yet remains which testify the Romans built as they wrote, for eternity ; it being impossible to look at this Surprising work without an idea, had no enemy attacked but time, like Horace, this edifice might have defied his power. From the amphitheatre I went to See the maiSon quarree, as it is vulgarly called ; a building as distinguishable for elegance and beauty, as the other for vastneSs and strength : It is a Roman temple, built by Augustus, to the memory of his grandfons, Luciirs and Agrippa.. Tlie portico and pillars, which Support the architrave, are of the
Coritb-
[ If ]
Corinthian order ; the chapiters are re-verSed, which one wmuld think should have an odd effedt; but all here is beauty, elegance, and exquiSite proportion. This piece of antiquity yields to none, except the Pantheon at Rome. It is to be lamented they have not, as far as possible, preServed the interior form of the temple, being made into a chapel for the Augustines has changed it much : However, one cannot look at the exterior without having the mofc elevated idea of the whole. 1 could not perSuade mySelf to quit this edifice, btit' by a resolution to revisit what has So highly charmed me. I have a passion for prints, becauSe they give a more perfedl idea than words can, of the antiquities which engage my attention, and mashe you, in Some degree, a companion of rny travels. The fountain
of
t	,
of NiSmes Is a most charming place r The foundations and aqueduO;, are modern, the work of the Romans, who may be traced wherever they have been masters, by their great and uSeful undertakings.	plantations, and
other decorations are modern. At this place is an ancient temple. Said to be dedicated to Diana ; a point not easily ascertained, nor do I See it is of any conSequence to the merit of the building, which, in my opinion, is not equal to the general estimation. The ruins are Such, antiquarians are obliged to imagine the beauties they deScribe; theSe gentlemen certainly understand better than others the detail of the excellencies and particular circumstances regarding the monuments of antiquity; but where there is nothing in an edifice which strikes and Speaks for itSelf, as
great
[ i; ]
great or beautiful, I cannot place it in a very high rank. A little distance from this temple is an ancient grand tower, built by the Gauls. I shall not enter into a diSpute concerning its ufe when eredled: The building is amazingly strong, but at prefent I cannot, either in point of utility or beauty, fee it in any other light than that of forming an objed in a landscape, or terminating a view in a park, where the effefi: would be fine. When I have related to Some French the fashion in England, of building ruins as ornaments to rural Scenes, I have Scarce gained credit: It is true, they wereperSons who had not been out of France ; but an imitation of wshat is beautiful, where an original is impossible, is an attempt So natural, I am furpriSed any one had not faith on that head. I am afraid you are more VoL.JI.	C	than

Cicero obServes, could one be taken; up to view all the beauties of the heavens, the enjoyment would be imper-fed, without Some perfon to whom the ideas they raiSed might be communicated ; in this, as in most other quotations, I depend upon my memory, and fear I do not give the exaft fenSe of the author : What is not Cicero’s, pleafe to accept as mine. I am Sensible of the inequality of this recommendation in general, but am vain enough to hope it may fucceed with you. I have received more amufement from NiSmes, than any town since I left Paris. The antiquhies have given me great fatif-fa<51:ion: Amidst thefe pleaSures be per-shaded how sincerely I regret your sh-ciety, and experience the truth of this

LETTER XXIX;

A HE city of Nifmes is ill built,' the streets very narrow, as in most old towns. The inhabitants are very numerous, thirty thoufand Protestants,’ C 2	and
[ 20 ]
and the Same number of Catholics. The people are much at their eaSe. From a comparison of this place to Avignon, may be Seen how much more advantageous the Reformed religion is to mankind, than the Roman Catholic : a strong prefumption in favor of the former. That God wills the happineSs of his creatures, is the most certain truth of any that engages the pens of divines, fays a celebrated French writer. In every point, but religion, and priestly government, which is an effedl of the Roman Catholic, the county VenaiS-Sin has the advantage of the county about Nifmes, being more fertile, and the taxes very moderate. The Protestants hot only enrich themSelves, by their industry and application to trade, but eaSe the Catholics, in Some refpedls; as they Support their own poor, and
prevent!
I 21 ]
prevent convents and priests being So numerous, as in other towns of the fame size : here is leSs Superstition than in most places in this nation. The constant Society and connedtion between the people of each religion; makes the Catholics avoid many follies to be Seen elSewhere, and renders the Protestants very attentive to recommend their religion by their lives. The bishop is a man of great piety and candor,. whole merit and holy life are acknowledged even by the adverSe party, whoSe prejudices rife to a most extraordinary height, I must own, though they are ray brethren. Judge by the following instance of their Sentiments in general. The people of the houSe where I lodged, assured me, the wild Beast in the Ge-vaudan was a jefuit. I know one of the Protestant divines, wlio v/as edu-C 3	cated
[ 22 ]
catefi at Geneva; he is a reaSonable, Sensible man ; and though they have endeavoured to give him the most rigid principles of CalviniSm, I found he had no objedions to EpiScopacy. I heard him preach; his language was good, and his fubjedt adapted to the congregation ; had the one been fine, and the other elevated, the rocks amidst which he was placed, would have understood as well as the audience. The Proteftants have but few ministers ; in general, they have no other qualification than courage and a ^od life; both are absolutely requisite. The people who are sick and old, have divine Service in their houSes, locking the door, and Setting a watch. In the Or-leannois, I happened to be in the houSe with a lady when her grand-daughter was buried ; the privacy and stillneSs gave I	So
f *3 I
So much the appearance of a murder, I could not stay till the ceremony was finished. At NiSmes they think their preSent state very free ; for though the Same laws which formerly perfecuted them remain in force, they are Seldom put in execution, except by the bigotry of Some inferior magistrate, of wshich I have known an instance, with regard to two gentlemen ; but they had immediate redreSs upon application to the court ^ this liberty and tranquillity the Protestants impute to the expulsion of the jeSuits; the fuppofed cauSe of that event, may render the King more favorable to them : Though his Majesty does not give himfelf the trou-' ble of examining every article of faith, no one can be better convinced of tliis point, that religion, or, at least, the particular part of it which endangers his C 4	life.
[ 24 ]
’ ' life, must be bad. The Protestants have formerly roSe in defence of a liberty to which they thought they had a rio-ht; but never were concerned in a ' ' conspiracy against the perSon of their Sovereign. I believe the King of France would almost change the nature of his power with the King of England, to enjoy the Safety of the latter, who, I am perSuaded, might paSs alone thro* his capital, without any danger to his royal perfon. It is certain, every princely virtue that can attend a King, or private, which may ornament the cha-radter of man, are his, and command a guard as numerous as his Subjedts ; yet all merit is ineffedlual, where a mistaken zeal is stronger than gratitude and reafon. Languedoc is a sine province, the people much stronger than in many provinces ; in the Orleannois,
Berry,
t i25 J

I have Seen women of eighteen' look like thoSe of fifty in England. France certainly is not So populous as the British nation ;.but an argument I have* heard to prove they want men particularly, is by no means decisive ; this is, the women working in the fields ; a circumstance which proceeds from the vast standing army, and the love of parade. The French employ men-fervants in almost every office in the houSe, that they may occasionally be turned into footmen ; I once Saw a lady with three behind her coach, who were all the Servants she had; when at home they were valet de chambre, cook, and la-quais. This may appear, at first fight; a trivial circumstance, but is not So in its effecsts. Indeed, every point is consequential.

Since I arrived at Aix, I have had a visit from a perfon who is of a province very remote from this. I dined
at
[28]
'at his houSe a few days after he had received letters of noblesse ; his father was in the' lowest rank of life. You can conceive nothing So ridiculous as a Frenchman when he first finds himSelf a Gentleman. Monsi de-----took par-
ticular pains, every moment, to call a poor farm-houSe his chateau, and a Set of laboring Servants, who waited on us without shoes or stockings, his gens. The lady’s behaviour was correspondent. They had an only Son, about ten years of age, and Seven in size ; who, from too great an application to embroidery, . and confedlionary, looked as pale as ashes, and thin as a Skeleton. The poor boy had worked particularly hard that day; the father ashed, if he did not think the table well arranged, assuring us it was entirely his Son’s performance ; and tho’ So young, as we Saw,
, •	h^
C 29 ]
he had kept his own linen in repair Several years. Monsi de --------, who is
really a fond parent, added at the fame time he should not, like many fathers, regard expence in his Son’s education ; on the contrary, as Soon as his requisite domestic qualifications were perfected, he should learn thoSe that were Superficial, and ornamental; as the languages, history, philoSophy, arms, &c. and then visit all the courts in Europe, particularly the British ; which tins gentleman (if a man can So Soon be made one) honors in a particular degree, as he imagines perSons of his birth are upon a better footing there than in France. Aix is a very handSome town; and being defended from the winds by the mountains, makes a very agreeable winter residence. Here is a parliament, and much good company. The Duke
dc
[ 3° ]
<le Villars has a very great houfe, when in this place : But no agrement can prevent me Setting out for MarSeilles to-morrow. Provence is a fine country, and particularly pleasing to an English eye, from the novelty of the Scene ; the mountainous aSpeft, and the produce So different from ours,, has infinite charms. The fruits are the finest in France, particularly the grapes, figs and oranges ; the latter, ingrafted on pomegranates, are what Voltaire fays must have been the forbidden fruit; none is in that state here, the reverfe, with the vegetables, which are very fine ; it makes a great part of the food of the country. The climate being hot, little meat is uSed, and yet the people are strong ; they are the handsomest in France. The water is exceeding good, whic^ I imagine is one
of
L	[31I
of the points which renders the South particularly Salutary ; in many parts of this kingdom it is bad. Wine is very cheap, but being drank new (a general defedt in France) it is So Strong and heavy, as to be very diSagreeable to a stranger; but the natives give it to tlteir children with bread, as a Soup. In proportion as nature is kind, art is negledled ;' if a Severe winter happens, they are more distrest than wc in our bad climate; I mean bad only in point of gardening; for I think Charles the Second’s observation is just, that ^climate is best which will permit people j to be most days in the year, and hours in the day, in the open air; and this advantage has England. The great heats in Summer, the terrible vent de biSe in the winter, render the air very disagreeable in the Southern parts of
France,
[ 3^ ]	:
France, and leave only the latter part of autumn, and beginning of winter, perfedtly agreeable to a stranger. The ' natives here, as in other provinces, make very little uSe of their houSes when it is possible to live out of them.
I paid a visit to a lady in Languedoc, who,^ with her daughters, propos’d a walk, and led me into a forest, where Some people v/ere hunting the wild boar. We followed the hounds for Some hours. The Languedocienne women are particularly lively and agile; in i other provinces, where they are not So able to walk, they sit in their gardens, upon the cours, in the streets, roads, and every where, except their own apartments. In this point we should do well to imitate them, with a reServe | to the roads and streets, which I think an aukward, idle Situation for a man,
1	and

and very unbecoming a woman. I once Saw a lady full drest, Surrounded with men talking and laughing. Seated upon a bench in the road between Paris and Versailles : I imagined she was an opera girl, but found, on the contrary, her rank was as much above, as the others would have been beneath ridicule. To this manner of living in the open air, amongst other cauSes, may be attributed the general chearfulneSs of this nation. It is certain an Englishman, with all his advantages, is Sometimes ready to hang himSclf, and pities a Frenchman, whoSe great Spirits incline him to " jump over his head. .Dhe French poS-SeSs the art of making themSelves more generally happy than the English ; but I should imagine, when the latter is happy, his bliSs must be greater, as if ariSes from Sentiment and refieistion, the “VoL. II.	D	others
I ^4^
Other’s from constitution, and inatten-cion ; to the latter all the French cuS-toms contribute. I was much SuipriSed visiting a lady upon the death of her Son, to find her in all the colours of the rainbow.- I expressed my astonishment when I returned home, to a gentleman,, who expressed as much on hearing the English fashion, siiying. Parents should never mourn for their children ; for it was great impropriety to wear that habit for an inferior. This idea of Superiority,. which is just in Some reSpeftSy is too strongly asserted in. France, by parents in general ; I am perSuaded their infiuence would be more lasting if it was acquired by a constant and early attention to the happineSs of their children : As it is, the influence ceaSes with the' necessity of compliance. A great French, autlior obSerres, grati-;	• ,	^	"	tude:
[ 35 ]
fiide is the principal law of the English ; for what goes under the denomination of law, is not strong enough to bind the people to their King, children to their parents, wives to their huS-bands, &c. Sure this is the greatest praiSe that ever was given to people, and, as it comes from a stranger, we may hope k is, in Some degree, just. Indeed I think, in most of thoSe points (perhaps all, if rightly understood) the ' BritiSn perform their duties, at least, as well as the French, notwithstanding tile Severity of their lavrs are Such ; if they alone could brino- virtue, and general order, this nation would See them flourish in the highest perfedlion. Added to the laws which regard the public, parents can confine worthleSs children, hushands wives, who merit that treatment, &c. The ladies,indeed, have taken D %	care
I
[ 3-6 ]
care to Soften the laws, with relped: to them, et elles ont pris bien le change; for at prefent there are more men who require the protedlion of their wives, than women who claim it from that connection. The married of your Sex, Madam, are Sovereigns in France, and most abSolute : The hushands are treated like the parliament; the privilege,, or at least the effeft, of remonstrating is lost. If you will permit me to Speak with freedom my Sentiments on this head, the ladies, in general. Succeed So ill in their government, both public and private, I am perSuaded every Sensible English woman, who has that disposition, would loSe it upon a knowledge of their fucceSs. I think the Englishmen have more reSpedl and tenderneSs for the Sex, generally Speaking, than the French *, but they do not
obey

Nothing an be more pleasing than the approach to MarSeilles : The town, the Sea, the mountains, and D 3	rocks,
■[ 33 ]	'
rocks, with the Bastidas d’alentour, form a Scene equally beautiful and variegated. The new part of this city is handSome, particularly the cours, and street which leads to the Porte de Rome.
The prodigious trade, and being a Sea port, brings a great concourSe of strangers. I have Seen Some singular habits; the most So was the wsife of an Indian merchant ; her veil reached almost to her feet, and her hair, which was braided with pearls and other orna-' nients, hung down her back to an amazing length. Through her veil, which was perfeftly transparent, might be distinguished fine and regular fea-tures ; her eyes shone like diamonds Set in yellow marble. MarSeillcs is the only town, on this Side Paris, where Such figures could paSs peaceably. The French make great complaints against i	the
r 39)
the English mob ; their’s, though nbt So Spirited to assert the public liberty, is' quite as much So to assert the particular liberty of being inSolent to strangers. A gentleman examining the bridge at Orleans, with great tranquillity, a mob came up and began to be very impertinent to him, meerly as a foreigner: he being an adroit fcholar of Broughton’s, laid Several of them upon thb ground in a moment ; the rest fled, with the greatest precipitation, thinking his power more than human. The gentleman who gave this relation was much pleaSed with the novelty of this Surprizing manner of fighting, as it appeared to him, and admired the perSon who So Vv^ell executed this art, though against his countrymen ; whom juS-tice and politeneSs made him acknowledge were very culpable. Two ladies D 4	of
[ 40 ]	i
of my acquaintance travelling in Eng- ! lish dresses, into the South, were, when descending from the chaife. Surrounded with a croud of people, who, examining their appearance very stridtly, exclaimed qu’est-ce que c’est que cela ? qu’st-ce qui c’est que cela ? till one, who gave the tone to the whole groupe.
Said, Ah ce font des maures i* From this decision none appealed, though the ladies were neither of them brown ; and one amongst the fairest of my countrywomen.------1 went to the play two
or three nights since ; it was le Depit amoreux. I interested my Self greatly in the quarrel of the two lovers, the only part of the piece which has any merit; but that I think extremely well expreS-fed: it concludes like the charming ode of Horace to Lydia, in a reconciliation equally pleasing rmcl natural. I
have
[ 41 ]
have heard many people obServe, marriages contradled where there is only al common good liking, are happier than thofe founded upon Strong passions; they may appear in this light to a third per-fon, who can judge but from the exterior, where a greater and more conftant tranquillity may reign : but thoSe who love to a certain degree, know there are pleaSures attending even a quarrel, Superior to any caSe experienced by people who live together in that insipid I Situation; which must be the conSe-I quence of forming Such a connexion with only a common good liking. I am perSuaded the tranquillity and po-liteneSs v/hich may be Seen in France, between married people, proceeds more frequently from indifference than unity of Sentiment.—As there was no play last night, I v/ent to a petit Souper,

compofcd of a dozen perfons, clergy, ladies, and officers ; the former are al-' ways at enmity with the latter, at least, in appearance ; accordingly they rallied the priests with reSpeCh to the ladies, faying, they had much better marry, as -do the clergy in England, than attend the ladies as gallants : To which one of them replied; Un pretre peut avoir tine foibldSe comme un autre homme, •mais fc marier, fy done ; fy done. A lady addressing me, with great SurpriSc and Spirit, Said, Et vos eveques Se ma-rient 1 Sancla Maria que je voudrois bien yoir |a femme d’un cveque, quelle • dtole de creature ! Many other things were Said, which equally shev/ the prejudices of education, if people have not xeaSon and SenSe to rife above them, and the danger of taking custom as a decisive judge of right and wrong. The
Send-

Sentiment of the priest and lady, arc far from being general to all Roman Catholics; there are many, and thofe of Such Superior understanding, they ouglit to balance ten times their number ; who think the celibacy of the clergy as destruftive of private as of public good. A propos to the clergy are you acquainted with Boileau’s Lutrin ? I thought it a good fatvr when I v/as in England ; but now being perfedtly verSed in the charadters, manners, and offices of the Set of people repreSented.^ it appears most admirable, that stroke of the enraged priest purSuing his ad-. verSaries to bleSs them, from a Spirit ost vengeance, and they at the Same time • hiding themSelves to eScape the blessing, as the highest inSult, is most exquisite, The two concluding lines of this chapter are very good:
Et
[ 44 ]
Et de leur vain projet les chanoines punis S’en rctournent chez eux eperdus et benis.
The clergy are So large a body, there must be many worthleSs perSons in their habit ; but to all with whom I am acquainted, I can impute no other fault ; except, that they demonstrate by their lives, as well as Sermons, a firm belief of the dodlrine of Supererogation ; they being attended with a degree of rigor and penitence, unnecessary for their own virtuous adlions ; therefore I conclude they are intended for the vices of others. Company breaks in, and obliges me to conclude lather Sooner than I intended; though I fear, not before you are tired of my letter. I . am.

It would likewise have deprived the court of many creatures, and rendered ' the anticipation of the public revenues
leSs eaSy.---A gentleman, who paid
me a visit the other day. Speaking of a perSon who was come to bathe in the Sea, related the following event : Being at Dunkirk, as lie v/as walking out of the town, he siiw, at a distance,
a vast
[ 47 I
a vast mimber of people all on foot.. Amidst the croud he could distinguisst ibme peiLns of Superior rank : When they drew near,, he aSked the occasion of this procession,, and was informed the young man of quality who walked first,, had been bit by a mad dog; the con-fcquences of which were So violent they could not get hLm into a carriage^ , though it was a considerable journey he had made ta bathe in the Sea. Amidft the distortions, an cl ravings of hie distemper, might be diScerned a most beautiful face, and fine figure. He was dreff fed in black, wkh eighteen footmen in the Same habit ; Some of them held him with cords, fastened in Such a manner he had liberty to walk, yet not to hurt himSelf; the others followed weeping,, with an old governor, almost as mad as: his pupil.. But the Situation of the father
L 4S ]
ther and mother, who made up this urt-happy Suite, wds beyond all description. They attempted to go with their Son to the ship, but the lady, from violent agitations of hope and fear, faint • ed, and was carried away as dead. The father persisted in feeing the operation performed Several times, for Several days, but without SucceSs. They were at length reduced to the cruel necessity (from the torments the young man Suffered) to call a consultation for the most eaSy manner of putting him to death : Bleeding was choSe, and accordingly executed. I do not believe you will thank me for this melancholy relation; but whatever strikes one, though painfully, it is natural to relate. I know not from what cauSe, but imagine it is the climate ; I never heard of a perSon who recovered after this
misfor-
1
[ 49 ]
misfortune in France. The affair above-mentioned miust have been tenib e to the most indifferent parents ; unhappily, theSe were distinguished for af-fedion to their unfortunate Son.—— As I do not love play, I Spend many evenings at the theatre; amongst other pieces, I have Seen Les Plaideurs ; the humor is very strong, but does not appear outree to thoSe who have lived long enough in this nation, to enter into the Spirit of the ridicule. The Normans are renowned for their love of chicanery ; but I thinK the fame disposition prevails all over France, at le^it, -- wherever I have reSided. Many families are ruined by this litigious Ijpirit, and yet law is very cheap to what it is in England. I know a town where a gentleman, his wife, and all the women of the place, were engaged
^9h Wi	S

in a law Suit; Several counSel were employed, and yet it did not cost above five guineas. The affair ended, as you may imagine, in favor of the wife, and other women, who raifed Such a party, the hushand could not walk in the streets without arms. Before the judges, in Small towns, and in trivial cauSes, people may plead for themfelves ; the women, who are very attentive, on all occasions, to preServe their privileges, assert this. Some of them difplayed their eloquence in a town where I was upon a visit; I had not the amuSement of hearing them ; yet I am Satisfied they Succeeded as well as the attomies, who are Sometimes the pleaders in theSe courts. A Set of people, as ignorant in general, as dishonest. A common Ibluier, and m.any things leSs honorable, affume this profession. The French
arc

I HAVE made an excursion, shme leagues from this place, to be preSent at the wedding of a gentleman with whom I have formed an acquaintance dunng E 2	roy,
I 52 I
my reSidcnce in this place ; the entertainment was very elegant, and we had a bal maSqite after Supper: this is an amuSement for which I thought their genius had been by no means calculated ; this being in a private houSe, was very well regulated; but I was once prelent at a public bal mafque, where the wit was folly, and the humor indecency : the great liberty of Speech which is permitted without a maSque, makes them know no bounds when they have that protedtion. What I Saw was in a provincial town ; I am told, the Parisian assemblies, of this kind, are much better, more brilliant, finer dresses, I conclude, but 1 should imagine the genius of the people is pretty much the fame every where. As to the ceremony of marriage, the only particular I have observed is the brides, (if they
have
[ 53 3
have never been married before) wear a little crown of Silver, or gold ; bift I believe this is peculiar So Some pro-^ vinces. Oh, I forget, there is likewise another Singularity ; fometimes the bridegroom has two or three boys i kneeling on his side of the altar, and the bride as many girls on hers. I Sup-pofe you know, wherever the canon law prevails, the children of two single people may, at any time, be legitimated by the marriage of their parents ; it is difficult to Say whether this cuS-tom is desirable or not. It is very right a man should, if he chuSes, legitimate ^ his own children; but by that adl he may very often legitimate other peoples. A gentleman, in a province where I resided, had married in this style ; after his death, the mother took a diS-iike to one of her daughters, and, to E 3	prevent
[ 54 ]
prevent her sharing in fortune with the ocner younger children, declared she y;.-s not the gentleman’s who had legitimated her, and propoSed to begin a law Suit to prove this shameful assertion. I know not whether she proceeded, but heard Several perSons of ^ knowledge in the law fay, she would only expofe herSelf if she did ; for the state of a child was too important a . point to depend upon the caprice of a mother, particularly one who, whether she Said truth or falshood in this particular, must be without truth or honor,
^ in general. You fee I am distrest for fubjeds in this place, or I should not give what I do instead of news. I have been Speaking of a singularity in one of the church ceremonies; give me leave to tell you another: This is the ordaining an order of exorcists, with I ,	the
I 55 1
the other orders of the priesthood. It is certain the common people in France are, as to their ideas of devils, witches. See. in pretty much the Same state they were in England, Some hundred years since; it cannot be otherwiSe, for though many of the clergy are too wife to exerciSe this power, they cannot own tiiey do not believe it ; and Some, whoSe heads are not So good as their hearts, believe de bon coeur, and a6t in conSequence. I am acquainted with one who Spoke to the Devil in a cloud, to keep the storm from the vineyards : but the greatest effeifi: I ever knew an exorcilsh have, was with regard to a Scotch officer of my acquaintance, who lay deSperately ill of a woiind he had received by the Springing a mine at a siege in Germany : he had a Highland Servant, just come from Scotland, who, E 4	from
[ 56 3
from his great attachment to his maS-ter, never went to bed ; when he could no longer watch, he wrapper! himfelf up in his plaid, and fiept in the corner of the room, which was very large. The people of the houSe recolledling the gentleman was a Catholic, Sent a priest to him one morning, about two or three o’clock ; he entered the apartment, which had only a wax taper, and a few embers in the chimney,
Which taught light to counterfeit a gloOni,
In this Situation he proceeded to the bedside, without Seeing the LLghlander, and began his exhortation to the gentleman, who being too ill to give much attention, the priest raiSed his voice So high as to awaken the Highlander, w'ho immediately starting up, betv:een Sleeping and waking, Seeing Something in black,
con-
[ 57 ]
eoncluded it was the Devil, drew his Sword, and marched up to the priest, who had not more favorable Sentiments of him, having a countenance full of fury, and his hair standing upright with fear; the Priest betook himfelf to the only arms he could uSe, waved his hand in the sign of a crofs, between him and his adverSary, repeating the terms of exorciSm, in nomine pater, &c. but trusting still more to a retreat, made the best of his way to. the door-, the Highlander feeing his enemy sty, purSued to the top of the stairs, brandishing his Sword ; where the priest, from fear (and having all the way walked backwards, die b tter to perform his office, and keep his adversary in view) fell at once from the top to the bottom, with great noife, but little hurt : the gentleman, whom

perSons who frequent it; there polite-neSs is in the highest perfetstion. I experienced more of that quality the day I was at Versailles, than I imagined strangers could find in any place without particular recommendation ; and I had none but what I have in common with every perSon who is his Britannic Majesty’s iubjedl:, and a gentleman. As they were rallying me, last night, at the theatre, a gentleman told us of the passion his wife formerly had for that amuSement (mine, you know, is only in preference to play :) he married the lady from the convent, where she had been ever since the age of Seven years: ehance had went beyond the intentions of the parents, having given the hush and and wife perSons and characters perfectly pleasing to each other ; though in the ktter there I	wast
[ 6i T
was Something of a contrast, imSome reSpeds. The lady placed a great degree of happineSs in the hopes of living at the theatre: She declared, as Soon as she arrived at the gentleman’s houSe, she should go to the play that night, and every one of her life, at the lame time desired her hushand’s attendance ; which is not absolutely ridiculous in provincial towns, though not perfedly polite. Her humor continuing for Several months, the gentleman ^ was rally’d by all his acquaintance, as added to the unfashionableneSs of attending a wife ; he was known to be of a grave and studious disposition ; en-; tirely unaffeded by the raillery, he an-Swered, I know the Sex will be attended ; as long as my wife gives me the preference, I will not resign my post to another, I Spend a few hours at an
amuSe-
f 62 ]
amuSement, , w: ich has no charms for me, in hopes of passing my life agree* ably with a perSon who has So many. The gentleman’s patience was rewarded ; after about six months offering to attend his wife, as uSual, she protested she should never desire to See another play as long as she lived, and went immediately into the country ; where her temper was formed to his and true bappineSs. You will be very glad to hear I intend to quit MarSeilles to- * morrow, as I am csistrest for lubjetsts to entertain ; the place having few objedls which merit attention, I am obliged to go back, or give French conversations; and few of them give pleaSure in the repetition, as I am perSuaded you find. They are very fond of wit; but, to do justice, they are easily contented on that LeaU. I will conclude, after desiring

firing absolution for all past defedls : I should be happy if you would imitate thofe priests who are So provident as to give it for the future. I am particularly Sensible my language is very im-perfeest. An attention to the .Drench has confuSed my English. This is not affedfation ; for I had rather you would imagine I know no other language than
o	o o
think I give any a preference ; as English has merit Superior to all modern of my acquaintance; and, what is more essential, it is the language of my country: but living much with the French, and having constant correspondence by letter, it is Scarce poS-fible not to learn Some of their idioms.

From Marseilles to Leghorn I had the finest passage irnaginable ; the Sailors wished for more wind, but I was infinitely pleaSed with this new and noble Scene, and did not desire a change. The dolphins came and played about the Snip sin great numbers, at a little distance the prodigious Spouting fiSh, throwing up vast quantities of water, with other marine wonders, prefented to my mind the great and Sublime description which Homer gives of Neptune and his attendants. The continuance of this fine weather, gave me an opportunity of obferving the Setting Sun, which has beautiful effedls upon this element ; and I was attentive not VoL. II.	F	to

Immediately after my debarkation at Leghorn, I Set out for Florence, which I shall quit tomorrow, as I propofe to make a resir^ dence when I return. In this city feeing many great and curious objedls, in a short Space of time, the imagination is highly struck, and ideas raifed So fast, it is impossible to give a just description ; for this reaSon,, and as the famous gallery has been often and minutely described, I shall only Speak of an objedl whoSe charms render Silence impossible : this is the So much, and deServedly celebrated Venus de Medi-cis.

One of the men was immediately concerned in an assassination at Paris; they were both public pickpockets at Paris, and took this inn, which I believe is forty or fifty leagues distant, for a retreat.

I T is Some days since I arrived at Rome, once the capital of the world, of which at prefent may be Seen the most magnificent remains. I will Speak of objedts as they are esteemed most curious, or as they have appeared most striking to me ; both thoSe points unite with regard to the Pantheon; but I have not words Sufficiently expreS-five for the noble architecture of this great monument given us by antiquity. The entrance is by a most magnificent portico. Supported by pillars of oriental granite, of an amazing height and size. When, with difficulty and regret this work is quitted, to vjiew the interior of ' -	the
[ 7' ]
the rotunda, the mind is iramediateiy filled with thefe ideas, which every Sacred building ought to raiSe ; but, in that point, none ever Succeeded So per-fedlly as this. Such a Surprising grand cffedt must ariSe from the Sublimity of the design alone ; the dimensions of this building being inconsiderable, compared with many others. For what is to be Said of the advantages of
O
the figure, and the manner of this temple’s receiving light, I refer you to Mr. AddiSon’s judicious observations^ in his Spedtators, on the Sublime, which I immediately recolledled, though it is many years since I read them. Do not imagine this reference is to Save mySelf the trouble, you know it is otherw/Se ; but I can only repeat his words, or fay Something leSs just : “ The ornaments “ of this building are. Some of them, F 4	sine
h
/
172 J
“ fine ; yet being mixed with many “ which have no merit, except that de- ' “ rived from Roman Catholic Super-stition, the latter disfigure as much as the former embellish.’’ I was extremely Surprised, Seeing a Virgin Mary by St. Luke, to find it So very indifferent a performance; for I did imagine they would have given him Some piece, which might have made us regret Such an author ; as it is, though I highly honor him as an evangelist, I am perfedly contented with a miserable Sinner for a painter. The Paiitheon has lost most of its ancient ornaments. They truly deferved that name; many fine statues have been taken away, and the bronze, with which the roof was covered, now m.akes the magnificence of the grand altar of St, Peter’s : Th t the Spoils of the ...	, Heathen
[ 73 ]
Heathen should adorn the temples of the true God, is very just ; but as this fine edifice {has been conSecrated as a church, I am highly difpleaSed it has been robbed to embellish any other, (much more that it has been injured for private uSes) as none can ever equal it; at prefent the whole glory of the structure must be given to the architect.—I shall next obServe the church of St. Peter : The court is the most noble I ever beheld, a vast collonnade condusts under cover to the church ; the pillars Support an architrave, ornamented with numerous statues of Saints and martyrs : In the midst of the court is a beautiful obelisk, and on each side a fine fountain. The outward appearance of St. Peter’s is, by no means, adequate to tnis magnificent approach, being much inferior to St'. Paul’s in beauty, tho’
greatly
I 74 ]
greatly Superior in size. The grand facciata is in a style which would be very handSome for a palace, but destroys the uniformity of the building as a church, and in that reSpeft gives a great advantage to the English temple. The interior of this building is very magnificent, but did not strike me as I expedted : it is agreed by all who fee this edifice, the more frequently it is viewed, and the greater the exadneSs , with which it is examined. So much higher is the admiration it raiSes : This I think an argument that the buildino: receives more from the ornaments than from, architedure ; the effed of beauty in the latter is immediate ; the former, where they are very numerous, must be considered before their merit is knowm. I believe many perSons confound the different effeds together; as ,	I do
- t 75 ]	,
I do not, though the excellency of the ornaments is great, I think there are too many, and too great a variety : a noble Simplicity, or ‘unity of orna-m.ents, appears requisite in a Sacred building. The number of chapels which call the view from its principal point, are to me a defedt; though each of them has beauties might alone make the merit of an inferior edifice. The grand altar of Bronze, Supported by pillars of the fame metal, of a greater height and size than can be imsgined (till the dimensions are taken) is a chef d’oeuvre in all reSpedls; as is the chair of St. Peter, at the upper end of the church. Supported by the collossial figures of the four great doctors ; a glory rifes to the roof of the building, the whole of gilt bronze. Beneath the chair is an altar, on each side of it is
a m.onu-
' \
[ 76 ]
a monument of bronze and marble the two statues which adorn the tomb of Urban the eighth, are of great beauty. To Speak of all thatdeServes atten-tention in this edifice, would be impossible in the compaSs of a letter ; therefore, with regard to the vast dimensions, and a detail of the embellishments, I must refer you to the books wrote for that purpoSe. The invention of Mo-Saic is of infinite merit, as it will prevent the great number of fine pictures, in this church, having the fame fate others have Suffered by the humidity of the air in the buildings where they are placed. It is an odd exertion of power, and whimsical exerciSe of his office, the Pope performs in baptizing or confe-crating Heathen images : As for instance the Jupiter from the Pantheon, which is now converted into St. Peter,
placed
f 77 T
placed in this church, and So highly re-verenced, his feet are almost wore with the pious kisses they receive ; of many I was a witnefs. The fame happy change has attended the figure now called St. Sebastian, in the church of St. Agnes. If the Pope has this power,, his charity should have extended to all the Heathens in the Rotunda, and have left them there. It is true, as every perSon’s Ideas have not a Catholic obedience, nor the Pope’s power is So expressive as the ancient statuaries, their works might have affedled the mind according to the intentions of the artists ; which would have rendered Some of them, perhaps, improper for a church, in our opinions, who go to - visit theSe Sacred buildings; but thole who go there to worship, might, by Pontificial faith, as well See a Magda-
“	len^
' [ 7n
.’ Jen in Venus, as St. Peter in Jupiter. I met with one objedl dilpleaSed me more than the above-mentioned g-reat convert; this is a gilt lamb, that makes a most conSpicuous figure in a little chapel, on the left as you go up the church. The ear may hear figures of Speech ; the representation of which, is too groSs for the eye to Support. Indeed, there is Such an impropriety, as well as So much folly, in the ornamental part of Roman Catholic churches in general, I prefer the plain state of ours, and would rather give up thoSe paintings and statues, which are just decorations, than Suffer the mixture. I have heard a perSon, who was undetermined (at least in appearance) with regard to religion, was adviSed, by the Protestant party, to take a journey to Rome, as a certain means of fixing him
in
3
L 79 1
in their principles, to the great Surprifc of his counsellors, he returned a protest Catholic, declaring that reHgion must be particularly Supported by God, which could stand where man did So much, in all reSpedts, to destroy it. This is a French story, in which I can make no other observation, than the perSon’s party being^taken before the journey, or he never could have made this decision; the contrary would, in my opinion, have been a more natural cffedt; and I fancy in this judgment I am not Singular. I am.

LETTER XXXVII.
To diversify the Subjedl of my letters, I -shall take leave of the buildings, till I have Spoke of Some living . objedts, from whom I have received much amufement and instrudlion ; whoSe merit is acknowledged by all who have the pleaSurc of their acquaintance ; indeed, fame and their works have carried their names where their perfons never appeared: TheSe are father LaSure and Jacquier, monks of the order of Mimims della T rinita de Monti, professors of mathematics to the Pope; how great their merit must be in that Science, being French, and having this preferment at Rome, is Suf-licient demonstration : I can add, from 3	my
[ 8i ]
my ov/n knowledge, their geniuSes are not confined to one study, and what is more extraordinary, they poffefs all the Sfavoir-vivre of their country, in the best and most unlimited acceptation, ever entertaining, with unaffedted modesty and humility, qualities as Seldom to be found in their profession as great and uSeful learning, and quite as requisite for the Society into which their talents have eiven them a distinguish-ed introdudtion, and where they return the honor ; for I think a perSon of Superior genius, who condeScends to affo-ciate with his inferiors, in this relpedt, confers as great a favor as when the condescension is in point of rank. It ' is certain, no Superiority is leSs pardoned, than that Sometimes affumed by perSons of distinguished understandings, and pride never So easily Sup-Vol! II.	Q	ported
[ 82 ]
ported as when arising from high birth; this appears to me very iinreafonable, and Unjust, as the former, though not entirely, is yet more a man’s own merit than the latter* I fuppoSe the rea-Sons for this manner of aCting are : every one is a ^udge of great rank, and few of Superior understanding ; and the advantages which may be derived from a connexion with the former, are more desired than any the latter can give.
■ Pardon this digrdsion, into which I have been led by the merit of thefe fathers ; but I do not intend it as an apology for them, as I never Saw the most common capacity attended with more eaSe and Simplicity. TheSe excellent perSons are united by friendship, Sim-pathy of taste, and merit, in which I believe them equal, though it is only fath^er LaSure I See frequently. From
ohuroh-
#
[ 83 ]
churchmen to churches is a very natural transition ; therefore I now paSs to St. John de Lateran, which pleaSes me as to the body of the building (I mean to Say the Nef) as vrell as St. Peter’s. The statues of the apostles are a very great and just ornament; that of St. Matthew is absolutely Speaking. After this church, is generally ranked Santa Maria Maggiore; if it was to be mired as a fine gallery where a most beautiful altar is erected, magnificent chapels, and innumerable exquisite decorations, I should grant the admiration is just; but, as a temple, it must be placed in an inferior claSs, and Santa ^ Maria degli Angipli have the preference; this is the Carthusians church. The figure, is a Grecian crofs, which J think more eligible than any, except the .Rotunda, for a Sacred edifice. It G 2	fills
(
.[ 84 ]
fills the eye better than the common form of churches ; this is not vast, yet it strikes as Such ; and St. Agnes, in Piazza Navonna, though extremely Small, from the advantages of the fame figure, does not appear So, at least not tliSagreeably little, as Santa Maria della jVittoria, and churches in general of that size, when built in the ordinary form. In the temple of which I am fpeaking at prefent, are the monuments of thofe eminent painters, Carlo Ma-ratti, and Salvator RoSa; the first was * designed by himSelf, and his brother formed the bust; the only honor, I think, one could refufe, to the memory of So near a relation. Here is a bap-tiSm of our Saviour, and many pieces of merit; but I cannot fay they are in ' general paintings, that, either strike or pleaSe me, St. Peter and Simon Ma-
gus
[ 85 ]
gus is esteemed, by Some perSons, a very good pidure; it is by Battoni; of him I will Speak, with other riiodern and portrait painters. The grand church of the jeSuits is extremely sine, the ornaments very rich; the rails of one altar are embellished with a considerable quantity of Lapis Lazuli. I Saw two of thefe edifices belongins; to the jefuits the fame day, both So equally magnificent, I confound their titles; but they are of no conSequcnce, nor would it give you any pleafure to hear, in a city where a great number of people want bread, St. Ignatius has more jewels than most princes in Europe ; a curious idea that, of Some monks going half naked, and perfedly nasty when alive ; and the figures of others when dead, more extravagantly ornamented than any fops at a ball. I G 3	men-
I
[ 86 ]
mentioned the form of St. Agnes’s church, in Pia'.sza Navonna; the architecture, by Borromini, is very beau* tiful, and the decorations are good. Many Sacred edifices in this city, which, in Some places', would command attention, and long journies be made to visit them, remain unnoticed from the great number of their Superiors ; that will be their fate with me ; for I do not intend to reSume the SubjeCt farther than, I may be induced by viewing Some particular pictures in theSe buildings.

Lhave been, since I wrote my letter, to See two pitstures of Salvator RoSa^ they are landSchapes extremely fine. Ic is difficult to do justice to any kinef of paintings by a description, but particularly theSe ; therefore I will not make an attempt. An imaginary land-Schape, in a poem of Lord Littleton’s,
I think is the prettiest I ever Saw in writing. After feeing the piDures, I paid a visit to a convent; there was a young girl, just come to town to take the veil, the handSomest perSon I have Seen in Italy. It is unnecessary to observe, the women in theSe religious houSes, are, in general, more beautiful than in France, as the Romans are a finer people ; but there are other reasons why the nuns in Italy should Sur-paSs the French in this reSpedl ; the custom of taking the veil is more com-G 4	mon, •
[ 88 ] - , ■ mon, particularly amongst people of fashion ; and as with them necessity, not' religion, is the motive, they generally go into orders that are not Severe ; on the contrary. See company, are at-' tended, many of them having Servants ; which is not allowed in France, except to royal abbesses, and chanoineS-Ses. Most of the French nuns lead a laborious life. I have heard Some of the Italians have their Cavalieri Servienti, who visit at the grate, and make presents : of the office of thefe gentlemen attendants, when attached to the women of the world, there is a comedy ©f Goldoni’s, which gives a just idea, as I have been informed by good judges, I do not pretend to be in the number. In Sienna this Service is in the highest perfedlion ; one woman has Sometimes six attendants : a lady of my
ac-

acquaintance fays, she has known many a man as tired of theSe mistresses as ever he knew any one of his wife ; but an ideal point of honour, as it is a perSon’s own creation, is stronger than that which exists independent of his will, consequently an apparent attachment is continued to the former ; though very often a man will not give himfelf that trouble with regard to the latter. .1 find I shall make my postscript almost as long as my letter. You cannot be Surprised I Say any thing rather than the painful word. Adieu.

J. HE capital piclures of Rome, and from their merit, I should imagine of the univerfe, are, first. The transfigura-q	tion

St. Jeronymo della Carita, not being universally knov/n, you may be imacquainted with the merits of this painting ; though, perhaps, upon the whole, they are equal to the piece I have mentioned. • This admirable pic-' ture is of Domenichini: The dying faint is receiving the communion (or rather jthe viaticum) according to the ceremonies of the Roman church ; his countenance is full of the greatest, and most just expression. Faith, hope, fear and reverence are blended together ;

ther ; and his wdiole perfon is expreS-five of his past life, and the great ap« preaching change. The attendant figures are equally good in their Subordinate rank : this piece, from the unity of adtion, most highly preServed, is, by Some critics, preferred to the tranS*-* figuration; which abounds with more exquisite beauties, and has the advan-tange of a more Sublime Subjedl:, but has not this merit in So great perfedlion. The third pidlure is in the church belonging to the Minims della-Trinita, De monti by Daniel Volterra, stiled. La depofizione di Christo della croce ; ' the takino; down Christ from the croSs,

of which one feels in the view) their . fear and reverence in touching the Sacred perSon, are highly expressed: the Virgin Mary, who is below the crols, fainting, is as great an exertion of the artist’s power as can be Seen, the shadow of death covering her face, but not her ientiments. This sine piece being upon txhe wall, has already received much damage in the coloring, and will Soon lofe all its excellencies. In this church are other paintings of the Same author : they are, with many more works of great masters, proofs we should never decide upon the merit of a performance from the name of the artist; j which is not very uncommon with | numbers who are, or at least paSs for, virtuoSo’'s. It is much the fame in re-crard to wit ; wshen a man has once ac-quired a reputation, a thouSand Speeches

paSs under that denomination without any just pretensions ; as many people have no other method of judging but by his name, and thoSe who have Superior knowledge, are afraid to assert it, in contradidlion to the Bon Ton, lest their own understanding, or modesty, should be called in question. The pidure of Saint Romualdo, in a chapel of the order of which he was founder, is added as a fourth piece by Some judges, but I do not think it has a right to be distinguished froni many others, which ornament the churches and palaces in this city ; indeed, there is not Subject for a painting of the first rank. The figure of die faint and his attendant diSciples, are finely colored, and highly finished, and have as much expression as their situation will admit but adion, passion,
and
t '94 ]
and Sentiment, are requisite, or rather all of them, to form a picture of the first merit : this piece is by Sacchi. You will think. Madam, my taste for painting has abforbed that of music: not in the leaSc ; but I cannot Say the latter has been So perfefiily Satisfied as the former : I have heard two or three concerts, which pleaSed me very well, and have been preSent at Some good church music. The Romans Say they have not So many good voices in Rome as they had Some years since: Thofe in the Pope’s chapel are most of them old, consequently not in their highest perfestion ; yet, whatever disadvantages music has at preSent, compared to the advantages it may have had in this place, it is certainty very fine ; a Surprizing eaSe and taste aGCompanying the.Italians, unkfno\wi to any other nation,
r 951
tion, but as derived from them ; the least air, wdicn performed by their hands, has infinite charms : this per-feDion not only the musicians by profession poffeSs, it attends the people in general; and in taste alone, it is persons of fashion here SurpaSs the French and English, in execution they are both Superior: the French are very great in this point ; their lively and ^ chearful disposition leads to a perpetual pradtice of a Science which diS-Sipates thought. The natural indolence of the Italians, joined to that acquired by education, renders them, in general, unfit even for So pleaSing an application. I believe there are as many great masters for the harpsichord, and as good musicians, for the theory of fmu-Sic, in England, 'as any nation ; but taste and elegance, as I beSore obServed,
must

You desire' Some information with regard to the Stuart family : my principles not leading me into the preSen.ce of the two remaining princes of that race, I must Sometimes Speak from the authority of others ; whenever I do, you will be a gainer, as I shall take the Sentiments of thofe who have judgment infinitely Superior to mine. I have Seen the Prince, en passant, and the Cardinal perform maSs : I do not think either of their perSons Singular enough to merit a particular description.

reign circumstances which attend them-.
The Prince never had much capacity, though in the year forty-five he certainly shewed great Spirit; since that time, the latter has Sunk to an. equality with the former, perhaps, in Some degree, from not having had occasions to exert it. When he had lived at his uncle’s, the Duke de Bouillon’s, he led the life of pleaSure and indalence, natural to disappointed and extinguished hopes. Pie then appeared So little of a bigot, the King of France Said to the Duke de Bouillon, J’entends que votre neveu va Se faire Protestant. To which the Duke replied; Pourquoi non ; votre Majeste | croit elle qu’il y’a un royaume de dif- j ferrence ? One of his friends affured me, upon ti e execution of his followers in England, he was So miSerable and melancholic, a Frencli lady went to vi-
Sif,
[ 99 ]
. fit, and addressed him in theSe terms ; Sir, you are not born to be a King; your life would be unhappy from the value you would Set upon that of your Subjedts. A very Sensible, and I should think, disinterested man, of the court of France, Said this was So far from true, during the time abovementioned, he was Seen at the opera, and every other place of amuSement, with the utmost gaiety; even to Such a degree, his child remarked (hearing a conversation upon the Subjedt) What heart must that man have, who could enjoy life when others v/ere losing it from their attachment to him! As this gentleman is a fond father, I can fuppoSe him capable of improving his Son’s Speech, or giving him his own ; but, as a man of honor, I should think it impossible he could invent the occasion ; though H 2 '	there
[ 100 ]
there are many French who are not Such well-wishers to the Stuart family as might be imagined from the agreement of their religious Sentiments. I heard one perSon Say, very justly. Did we not refuSe the throne to the great Henry Quart, meerly from the difference of religion ? How much stonger then is reaSon on the side where every cauSe combines ^ It is well known the Prince did not 'find a favorable reception at Rome after his father’s death, which obliges him to a life of great Solitude; as he will not See the Italians upon the only terms they are permitted to visit him, he has no Society but his own houshold, and that is veiy Small. The Cardinal is a man of great piety, and stridl morals. As to understanding, you are acquainted how great an effort nature made in favor of the fa-

mily in the perSon of Charles the le-cond; and he shewing no gratitude, but, on the contrary, abusing her va* luable gift, she immediately returned to her former negligence. ThoSc who do not like the Cardinal, and Such there are (though, as a Cardinal, I can fee only merit) Say he is a bigot; his friends, that he is strongly attached to his religion, in the preSent state of the family (in which it will ever remain) this is a point mighty indifferent to an Englishman; he will, probably from his influence over his brother, attach him to the Catholic religion, if he is not already attached. The Cardinal has Several benefices in Italy, he is Chancellor of Rome, Arch-priest of St. Peter’s, and Bifliop of FraScati : I believe Some of theSe are rather honourable than lucrative ; but the Priory of Amand,
H3	in ''

m Flanders, which the Prince received from the King of France, is fifteen or Sixteen thouSand a year sterling. The Cardinal has great merit in his fraternal affedtion, as it has rofe in proportion to his brother’s distreSs, who is obliged to the revenues of a state, in which he highly disapproved an engagement. You will be Surprised to find me mention natural affection as a mierit ; I grant you have reaSon, yet I can plead the highest authority; for Horace Speaks of this kind as a great virtue, as you will not thank me for the Latin, I will endeavour to render the fenSe in English, though very indifferently ;

thoSe alone that preSent themSelves to my memory So strongly they oblige me to. a distindtion.

The greatest masters in Italy here make their efforts to diSplay the powers of their art; beyond them all, Raphael distinguishes his genius in the highest perfedtion, and his Superb battle-pieces are, in general, esteemed the most valuable of his performances, if considered with regard to the vaStnefs of the work, grandeur of the design, and multiplicity of figures ; he certainly, in theSe, not only Surpasses all
others,
.	. t ]
others, but himSelf. Yet there arc lesser pieces, more highly sinished,which,
I think, give greater pleaSure in the contemplation, though they have not that Surprising grand effed. The School of Athens might amuSe for montlis ; indeed, all Raphaels works should be studied as well as Seen ; their beauties Speaking to the Understanding yet more than they charm the sight. The sire is an exceeding good piece; the delivery of St. Peter from priSon, and So many others, it is impossible to proceed : my memory, upon a first view, can retain but a very Small part of the excellent paintings which adorn this palace ; to them I propoSe frequent vi- , sits: at preSent I will Speak of the library, in geneneral terms, as I have of thePiCtures. You are well acquainted the Vatican library is esteemed the finest
in
[ i°7 ]
in the world, whether you consider the books, or the buildings, in which they arc deposited : the merit of the'latter I ^ can atteist, as to the former, much time must be Spent to forni a judgment. I Should imagine the learning of the Schools comipoSe too great a part of this library. I can make no other observation of this kind of literature, as far as I liave heard it adopted by Some divines, except that it is not Sufficiently clear, to convince, be refuted, or understood, but excellent at confusing the ideas of the audience. This building is painted in compartments, with Subjedls , agreeable to the poffeffors, and the ufe for wliich it is designed ; the histories of Popes and Councils, with other events reo-ardino; the church, stshere are like-wife a vail: number of pictures of learned pcrSons, particularly churchmen. 3	The
[ *o8 ]
I'he paintings have a very fine efihdl:. Indeed it is impossible to conceive any thing more beautiful than theSe apartments, or more extraordinary than their amazing length, which is a perte de vue.
I will now paSs through the palace to ■the Belvedere; yet muSt stop to look at a Cleopatra, whoSe merit might long engage attention; but upon entering the court of statues, all other ideas are lost, by a view of the greatest wonders this art ever preSented to fight: The principal is the Apollo ; where beauty without effeminacy, lightneSs and elegance cf figure, without weakneSs, grace, youth, in short, all the perfec-	|
tions which can attend the human si-	j
gure, are represented in the highest degree. The Laocoon has as great merit from terrible, and painful, as the Apollo from pleasing expression. Here
is
[ i°9 J
is a fine Antinous, and Several other statues of great beauty and excellence. The celebrated TorSo of Hercules, is, I [think, too much maimed for any perSon, who is not an Antiquarian by profession, to diScover its perfection : there is, indeed, prodigious strength and proportion, as far as remains of the . figure; as for the qualities of the foul, which Abbot Winkleman pretends to See and admire ; they might just -as easily be distinguished in the nails of a man’s fingers as this trunk. In short, I must confeSs I am not far enough advanced in my love of antiquity, to have any taste for this piece, in which I can find no expression, the higheSt beauty and merit of every human figure formed by God or man.. It is this Sentiment that renders the following lines of Lord Littleton the most comprehensive, tho’
the
[ no ]
the most conciSe description it is pof-siblc to give of beauty, as well as virtue :
Her form each beauty of her mind expreft ; Her mind was virtue, by the Graces drest.

OU are SurpriSed Lean be So long . in Rome without mentioning the Pope more particularly. The prefent Pontiff, Rezzonico, has no qualities that command attention; though his Holi-
neSs,
[ III ]
neSs, and the Romans in general, de-Serve the esteem of all strangers, for the eaSy Situation, and agreeable reception, they find in this city. I will give, in few words, the general character of the Pope ; which is perfedlly agreeable to what I have heard from tlioSe who have the honour of a perSonal acquainbance with his HolineSs.—Pie is an honest man, and good priest, but very indifferent prince, not possessing, in any degree, the talents requisite for government ; nor has he much taste for the arts and Sciences, who lost their great protestor in Lambertini. In Speaking of a Pope, the nephews should be introduced, as they have generally a great share in forming the charaftcr of the reign. TheSe gentlemen are, in Several points, a contrast to each other : the eldest, a pious man, would always ‘	do
[ II2 ]
do well if his understanding could di-redl the means; and, as it is, being an honest man would do Some good, if a mistaken devotion did not engage him to Spend the time at his breviary, when he Snould be giving audience, and ad-ing for the public welfare. The younger brother is a man of parts, but not So well inclined. The city of Rome is very ill inhabited, both in quality and quantity. It is compoSed of princes, or nobility, clergy and beggars, Scarce any of that rank of people neceffary to the fiouriShing state of a great city, merchants, artizans, &c. As here is no commerce, and So few manufadurers, it is no' wonder the people are in Such a deplorable state. How destrudive an eccleSiaStical government is to the well-being of a country, has been too often demonstrated for me to 3	make
X “3 ]
tnake any valuable additions; there-*' fore I shall not dwell upon this Head : indeed, a comparison of the former state of this city to the prefent, is alone fufficient demonstration. I should think this government cannot fubsist longj the revenues decreasing which arofe from fuperstition, and no other methods taken to fupply that deficiency. Rome has fome refource in the strangers, v/hom the antique and other curiosities attrafS, and which by law are forbid to pafs into other nations ; but thofe who can make an advantageous diSpofal of thefe effedls, find means to evade the prohibition. The paintings of private perSons quit their country in great quantities, as England can testify : but there will, for many ages, remain in Rome fufficient to engage all thofe who have leisure, and taste, to visit this VoL. II.	I	city.
[ H4 ]
city. The ruins of ancient buildings, fine modern edifices, and paintings, &c. v/hich belonging to the public, or communities, cannot be alienated ; the manners, agreeable to the nature of the government, are, consequently, very-contrary to the prosperity of the city. Indolence, and a passion, for luxury, and pleafure, appear the preSent cha-rafteristics of a people, whoSe natural Superiority of genius might lead to distinguished actions. I Said, in one of my letters, how much we were inferior to die French in love of parade ; we are yet more So to the Italians. I know an instance of a gentleman in France, j who, having twenty or thirty Servants, one Son and four daughters, was obliged to lessen his family: he did, by forcino; all the ladies to be nuns. I am perSuaded this is too common a cir-
cumStancc
C II5 ]
cumstance to be remarked in Rome. Even thoSe who have neither birth, nor bread, attempt equipage and figure; which, I think, is not the cafe in England : and in the general luxury of the states, hhere is this great difference ;
I
. the English arifes from riches, and encourages commerce; the French and Italian, in Some points, from poverty,' and prevents industry : a vast number of domestics, retained by perfons of moderate fortune, proceeds from the distreSs of the people, and continues it, by , giving a habit of idlenefs. The ' great wages of Servants, high prices of workmen, and dearneSs of provisions,’ are thought by Some evils : in England, ' they are by no means to be regarded in this light by thofe who prefer public profperity to private con-veniency; on the contrary, they are Such 'I 2	Strong
^ ’ \
[ ri6 ] ,
strong and/clear indications that trade and manufaftures flourish, and riches increaSe, it is Surprising to find perSons So fond of looking on the dark side of the objedt, as to imagine any one of theSe circumstances can drive the English, particularly the people, into foreign countries : What advantage is it to a man he can buy a pound of meat for one penny, ^which he may, in Some parts of Italy (provisions being cheaper than in France) when he will have more difficulty to gain that one, than ten in England ? A Nation where fortunes may be made, and property ascertained, will ever be well inhabited. As for a few EngliSn, who have fettled at the head of manufadlures in France, they have greater advantages than could be .given .to numbers ; yet, high as are thoSc advantages, I am perSuaded they 3	would
[ ”7 ]
■would not have been accepted, if thofe perSons could have enjoyed the privileges of British fubjefls, to which they were born : I know this is true, v/ith regard to Some, and must SuppoSe, to , all, if they are not very short-sighted; no one who is not, will, for any present advantage to themSelves, deprive their posterity of an English Birthright. If Some families, whoSe fortunes are inconvenient, live in France to .make them convenient, it is only for a time ; and if they Succeed, it is not So much from the cheapn-eSs of the country, as being content to live in a lefs way than they chufe at home; were it otherwise, they would be no proof that the common people could find their interest in living in France, as theSe desire not to gain, but Save ; and the difference ot expencc, in the two nations, is not in I 3	meer

meer necessaries of life, but indulgen-gences, and luxuries. To the English may be applied this line of Virgil:
O Fortunati nimium ! &c.
Thrice happy they! did they but know their blifs.

[ 119 ]
■dience, nor have any other to claim.
L will just mention Monte Cavallo, as it is the palace where the Pope constantly resides, the air being esteemed ' the finest in Rome. The buildings are nothing extraordinary : in the apartments are Some good paintings, but much inferior to thofe in the Vatican, and many other palaces, particularly the Collonna, which is in the first rank. The gallery is tlte sineSt I ever Satv, much Surpassing the celebrated one at Versailles. The apartment is of a vast length, and just proportion : at the upper-end are Some beautiful pillars, of antique yellow marble ; but what makes the principal ornament, and riches of this gallery, is the paintings, which, though very numerous, are, in • * general, of' the highest merit. The ' -ceiling is very fine, representing the ^	' I 4	vidory
' [ 120 ]
vidtory of Lepanto, where Marcus An-tonius Collonna commanded. But the beauty of this painting is infinitely Surpassed by that of the pitstures and statues, which decorate each side of this magnificent gallery; they are most exquisite. Of thefe, and the paintings in the other apartments, where is every variety of style, I will Speak when I have taken a review ; but they are So numerous, and beautiful, it is impossible to avoid an agreeable confusion at first sight. Of the Cameo’s Intaglio’s, &c. I fay nothing, except that I am extremely pleaSed with what I have Seen of this kind here, and in other palaces; though little objedls, they demand a greater attention than I have yet been able to give them. If I stay in Rome the time I propoSe, shall endeavour to form a judgment which
may
[ ]
may deServe your hearing. The Far-ncSe palace is esteemed, in point of ar-chitedure, the finest in this city ; - Michael Angelo was the architcd. The greatest part of the stones of this edifice were taken from the Colloffeum of VeSpaSian. The entrance of the palace is by a grand portico. Supported by pillars of the Doric order, and leads to a court tvhoSe buildings are Supported by arches, vritli long corridors. The celebrated Statues of Hercules and Flora, are in this court; and in another, is the most prodigious and magnificent groupe, which repreSents the fable of Dirce. It is Surprising they do not^ find Some place it may ornament, in-st;ead of being shut up as lumber: notwithstanding the great quantities of fine Statues in Rome, this piece deServes a Situation wdiere it might be Seen, and
the
[ 122 ]
the size alone would command attention. The grand stair-caSe and hall, are enriched by the Sculptor’s art, both ancient and modern ; amongst the latter is Alexander FarneSe, crowned by Vidlory, with Flanders, and the ES-caut at his feet. In the gallery, painted by Salviati Zuccaro, is represented ' Charles the fifth, and Francis the first, civing hands; the memorable a6ls of Paul the third, and Luther, in conference with the Pope’s Nuncio. The finest painting in this palace is the gallery, by Hannibal Carracci; the fub-jeft is, the triumph of Bacchus; the Cyclop is esteemed a chef d’oevre of that author ; it certainly has great merit, but not of the Idnd which most pleaScs me. If the Scheme propoSed had taken place, of joining the little FarncSe to this palace by a bridge, it
w'ould
[ 123 ]	'	‘
would have been one of the finest in Europe; and the interior.beauty would have been correspondent. The paintings in the Longara, being most exquisite, they are by Raphael; the Loves of Cupid and Plyche the Subjcifl:': No pencil but his could have executed Such a work, the beauty and variety of expression is incomparable. In the Feast of the Gods, the particular attributes of each divinity are So finely marked, and v/ith Such strength, they Speak at once themSelves, and the great hand which drew them. I could dwell upon the beauties of Venus and PSyche; the inexpressible grace of the former, when she petitions the gods im favour of Cupid ; the motion of the goddeSi, requiring the pen of Virgil, or the great modern English poet, to deScribe (mine can give no idea) the different - • . -	.	charms
[ 124 ]
charms of PSyche, agreeable to her change of Situation; and how finely Raphael has realized the graces. But I find, though in Speaking of this palace I have been far from entering into ' a detail ; yet I have been tedious, at least I fear you will think me So, and not permit a performance of my promise, with regard to others. Tell me freely your Sentiments, I shall, at any time, quit the most pleafing Scenes Rome can exhibit, for the pleaSure of writing. I am.

The Barbarini palace is esteemed in the first rank ; it appears to me rather a large houSe, Something is wanting to constitute the idea of palace ; if derived from the building, if from the inhabitants, this has the Same preten-' fions as many others; each floor has a Suite of nine or ten grand apartments ; in the first are Some fine Cartoons, by Pietro Cortona and Romanelii ; the riches of this family were So prodigious in pictures and statues, large as the houSe is, great quantities lay rolled in upper apartments ; and though the preSent princes have diSpoSed of a vast number, a considerable treaSure yet remains, The piece which most struck
and
[ 126 ]
and pieaSed me, is the death of Germa-niciis, by Poushn. I do not give this as my particular taste, for I believe it has as many admirers as obServersc How can it be otherwiSe, where a o-reat and happy execution attends a most noble and afiefting SubjeD. In one of the apartments is a fragment of MoSaic, representing Europa, taken from the ancient temple Della fortuna Prenestina, and a piDure of the Otto., of Florence, (orratherthereSembiance)madc of earth, by the touch of Giovanni da GambaSi, a blind man. TheSe I mention as curiosities ; a child, by Guido Reni, pleaSed me greatly, from its beauty. In this Suite of apartments are many pictures by Titian, a Madonna by Raphael: in the grand hall arc m.any Cartoons by Andrea Sacchi, and Pietro Cortona ; the roof is painted by the latter. A picture
[ 127-1
ture of a cavalcade, by Tempesta, pleaSed me from the idea it gives of that ancient and magnificent shew; this was taken from an entertainment given in the Piazza Barbarini, upon a marriage of one of the family. In this place are the fmall antique statues of the three Graces, two piDures by Leonard da Vinci ; whoSe value is greatly , enhanced, from the fmall number remaining of that author’s works. With, regard to the celebrated Magdalen by Guido, I must beg leave to dissent from the general opinion. I have heard, a thouSand pounds were offered for this piece ; to particular taste no bounds can be Set, but it was certainly more than the value of this picture, according to the Sentiments of most connoif-feurs (though their estimation is high) and much, much more, if I may be per-3	mitted
[ I2S ]
stiitted to Speak mine. Hamilton’s pic--ture of innocence Sold, I believe, for about fifty pounds ; write Guido under that, and a modern name under this figure, and, I am perSuaded, the difference would not be So great. The Magdalen, by Guido, is represented in the wilderneSs, as plump and wvll-iooking as she could have been in Herod’s court. I have read a Sermon where many of the highest authorities are brought to prove her face was in that taste, and as many to prove the contrary : the preacher determines at last with great Juftice^ her countenance changed according to her manner of life. This being a French Sermon, un- j happily Guido has not received the least advantage from Such an excellent performance. la the EorgheSe palace is a Small Magdalen, by Flannibal Carracci,
which.
[ 129 ]
v/liich, in my opinion, has infinitely more merit: in this piece, penitence, and horror, of her crimes, are painted in the strongest colors *, nor does the author Sacrifice expression and propriety of character, to beauty; (as does Guido) One Sees she has been hand-Some, but liaggard cheeks, and enlarged features, leave only the remains. Where Guido shines, and where aloge he is equal to the other great masters, is when beauty and grace are the Sole requisite expression : Such is his Aurora, in the RoSpogliosi palace, to which I can give no encomiums that will, in any degree, do it justice: call to mind the m.ost beautiful and luxuriant description, by the greatest poetical ge-* nius, of Aurora, and her attendant fi-sures ; and here See it realized.

In Spite of the mal-arrangement, the pleaSure I receive is inexpressible ; and I can distinguish Domenichini’s MuSe, his St. Cecilia, with a countenance expreshve of the -harmony residing in her foul.

I v/ill finish with the CorSini palace, that does not require So much time and attention ; though here is variety, and Some good authors ; an Ecce Hom.o by Guercino, exquisitely sine ; a beautiful Madonna | by Guido, It is certain, the veneration Catholics have for Sacred images and paintings is not So ridiculous (though equally blam.eable v/hen carried to a high degree) in Italy as France ; where I made a great blunder, taking the celebrated Notre Dame de Clery, for I	St. Louis j

A O change the Subjedt in Some degree, I will Speak of the public beau-, ties which ornament this city ; amongsh' theSe are the obelisscs : A very fine one, with Egyptian hieroglyphics', i^placed
[ ]
ki the Piazza del Popolo, where it has a great effeft, not only at the entrance of the gate, but as it forms a point of view to Several streets. It was made five hundred and twenty-two years before the birth of our Saviour, and brought from Plcliopolis to Rome, in the reign of Augustus. In the Piazza Navonna, which is very handSome from the buildings and ornaments (not from the figure, for that has no merit) is another Egyptian ObeliSic : It forms a point to the capital fountain, which is in a large baSon covered with white marble. In the middle of the bafon I riSes a rock cut into four grottos; at
-	■	■	,	.	t
each is a noble statue, reprelenting one -of the following great rivers : The Danube, with an oar in his hand ; the | •Ganges, by the figure of a Moor ; ti:e Nile, with his head covered ; and the
fourfiji
%
[ 139 ]
fourth is the Silver River, or River de la Plata. In this Piazza is another fountain, distinguished for the great shell of marble; but meer marble is too common to deServe a look in Italy, except from a refieshion on the beautiful and Surprising shapes into which it may be wrought. This city has, in most Piazzas, many Streets, and even iiouSes and fountains ; I cannot gueSs at the number, it is So great: the idea of their uSe, and the refrefiirnent they convey in So hot a country, adds much to their beauty. Above them all, I must distinguish the fountain Di Trevi, which stirpastes every thing of the kind I ever Sav/. I'he performance is modern, and a demonstration the Same Sublimity of design and execution, attends the preSent, as the ancient Romans, if they had as great advantages:
This
E HOT J
This fountain being alone more Strikingly noble than all the v/ater-works at Versailles. Perhaps you will think me partial to Rome, and all I See in this city. I acknowledge I had rather reside here than in Paris : yet I can diS-cern vshere the latter has the advantage. Les places, from the regularity , of the figure and uniformity of their buildings, as well as size, have Such 'a Superiority, it is almost an affront to name them with the Piazzas of Rome ; which are all contemptibly little, except the Piazza Navonna, and that is irregular in all reSpechs. The apart- ' ments of the French hotels are more - conveniently diSpoSed than the Italian. The public walks atParis are great beauties, and very agreeable,;! the constant-theatrical entertainments; Some in high perSedbion, are yet greater plcaSures ;
but
[ HI ]
tut theSe appear to me inferior merits however, they are all truth can give, Flad we a preference for the Italians;, it would not be Surprising: they highly distinguish tl,e English ; indeed they have a Sovereh. n hatred for the French, whole vanity will not acknowledge this point. Frenchmen, who have never been out of their own province, declare, Que le Francois est aime partout; and thoSe whom experience has ‘convinced to the contrary, fay, it is the jeaiouSy cf the Italian Iiushands vrhich makes them fear the agreeablenefs, and consequently hate a Frenchman ; but whoever has made any residence in Rome knows Roman jealouly bids fair to be as great an antique, as any this city can produce ; and if the Italians really had this passion to as high a degree as the' French chafe to imagine, the number
of
[ 142 ] ■
of that nation who visit Italy, is ndC Sufficiently great to raiSe a general hatred, which goes So far, if you name a French Saint, the common ahSwer is, E gran Santo, e peccato che Sia FranceSe, he is a great Saint ; it is a pity he is a Frenchman. The reaSon of this aversion, which has deScended from fiither to Son, ever since the wars the French have had with the Italians, is the rav<?ges committed by the former; the Italians fay they were too great to be forgot in a few generations. I have heard more than one French officer avow, their troops are too v/antonly cruel, even for their ovrn interest, destroying in one day what might fupport them ten, all the commands of their officers (notwithstanding their strifl difeipline) having been often ineffeflual to restrain the common foldiers; this made the Duke

de Randan’s SucceSs in that point, do him particular honour the last war. Whatever is committed contrary to hu* > manity, must:, in general, be imputed to the people',, who, on Several occasions,, have demonstrated they do not merit the character s;iven to the Ens;-,liib by a French writer; Un peuple Sage dans Sa fureur ; an eulogium, I hope they will continue to deServe.

appear to me very abSurd, Le Teste deli’anima bcata, e deiranima dannata ; The heads of a Soul in bliSs, and cf a Soul damned; but the expression of happineSs in the one, and miSery in the other, is well executed.

LETTER XL VI.
I AM this moment returned from the Colonna Trajana, which is still entire ; a noble monument of antiquity, and the gratitude of the Senate, and Roman people, to the excellent man whoSe name it bears. This pillar is now badly Situated; yet one may conceive how great must have been the effedh when it was placed in the midst of the Forum, built by the Said Emperor ; upqn this Colonna is represented the Dacian war. It is obServed^ from the figures of thefe basso relievos, which are finely executed, Raphael VoL. II.	L	took

took the habits and arms of his warriors, in Some of the Vatican battle-pieces. I could give the exadl dimensions of this fine monument, but they would add very little to your idea of its beauty, which is very great. At the top of the pillar was a statue of Tra^ jam, with a Scepter and globe, where were his ashes. St. Peter now Supplies his place. I had wrote thus far when I was favoured with your letter;, in that you alk, amongst other questions,. Whether murders are as common in Italy as has been represented ? in an-Swer to this I can only Say, none have happened in Rome within my knowledge ; which,, perhaps, is no more than a proof theSe accidents have not happened to perSons of conSequence. News-papers, where thoSe and many other private events are published, I.
be-
V

[ 147 ]
believe, are peculiar to England. A X-'rench lady argued. We must have more murders in England than in any nation ; for fire could read English, and Saw them in the papers: she might, by parity of reaSon, have Said, more children were born there than in the Grand Signior’s dominions. To do justice to the Italians, as far as a few months residence in Rome will permit me, I can See nothing in the disposition of the people to render murder more frequent than in other nations; that they were So in this city, and are yet in parts of Italy, must be owingTo a defedl in the government, their great poverty, and the eaSe with which they eScaped punishment; thoSc who could not pay Sums of money, taking refuge at privileged altars, a great abuSe and dishonour to religion. The poverty of L 2	the
[ 148 ]
the people remains; but the other eaufes lessen every day, and the effects will Soon be inSenfible. It is certain, the light of the reformation extends to thoSe who do not embrace its dodlrine. The Roman Catholics, as you may imagine, will not acknowledge this truth; on the contrary, they aliedge, Protestantifm has, in Some, decree, destroyed religion, and that a general Ih berty of conscience would compleat the destmstion. To strengthen this,, they talk of the piety of former ages, and the decreafe of religion in the preSent ; which cannnot be granted, unleSs, as I SuppoSe, the definition of religion is very different. If the Catholic ideas only reach the external pomp and pratfUce 'of ceremonials, with a belief of all the church of Rome commands, they have reafon in this light; but if, as I believe,,,
I
I
T 149 1
'iieve, all Protestants understand the Christian religion, morality making the most essential part, we have only to compare, with coolnefs and impartiality, past ages to the prefent, and we shall find the Superiority of the latter, tho’ not -So great as might be wished. The vices and faults of the ancients are viewed at a distance, their effedt cannot extend to us, while thoSe of cotemporaries are in the strongest point of light; and we may Sometimes See too much by them to judge with iridifference.--------The Go-
vernor of this city is an Ecclesiastic, as is natural in a priestly government; the principal offices are held by perSons in that profession ; the commanders of the gallies alone ex.cepted. They are all men of high birth. I have beard a gentleman obferve, thoSe vessels contain a heaven, and a hell; but I should
H 3	shave '
[ 15° 1
have no idea of enjoying the former sh near the latter. Even the Pope’s guards have a prelate for their commander ; I did not remark them when I Saw his HolineSs; but I well remember his Soldiers at Avignon were a burleSc|ue-.upon every thing that is military. The Police in this city is very exaD, and extends to many points, the honesty or eaSy circumstances of the English tradesmen renders unnecessary. Notwithstanding the Etiquette is So high. Some years Since, at a concert in Cardinal Prince Stuart’s palace, three or four Italians left the assembly on hearing one of the company was engaged in commerce, (a perSon prefent assured me, he who gav.e the offence was a man of quality. Some of the offended not gentlemen) yet they allow them-felves, in the French term, to faire va-
loir ;
,	N
[ 151 ]
loir ; which they do, to So high a degree, once this winter, by a monopoly of oil. Said to be made by Several persons of the first rank, the poor were deprived of this necessary. How far commerce and nobility may be inconsistent, in Some countries, I will not pretend to determine, nor have any interest in the decision ; but this is very clear, thoSe who deSpiSe the honest part of buSineSs, and the commerce advantageous to the public, should not deScend to pradtiSe by themSelves, or agents, what is the reverSe. The vast number of new families made every reign by the nature of this government, are very prejudicial to the public. The Popes give rank and titles, but their Support must come diredlly or indiredtly from the people ; the foreign refources, as I-ihave observed upon another occasion, L 4	bein^
[ J52 ]
being very inconsiderable : as there is always a probability of a short reign, the expedition is the greater (and consequently the oppression) in acquiring 'fortunes ; and if fucceSs is not equal to their efforts, pensions from charitable foundations, are often given to Support rank. Whether a man is called Duke, PrlncCj Count, or by his name, is a point of no essential conSequence to the public ; but if they are to pay the title, it is a high injustice, unleSs he has merited it by his Services to the nation ; and when that is the caSe, there will never be even a murmur, that claimants are too numerous. If one was to come immediately from England to Rome, the astonishment would be great, to find it is impossible to Speak to an Italian who has not a title ; but it is not So strildng in France, where the 2	ladies
[ 153 ]
ladies Sometimes create a Marquis, as they name a trump; this title being ’ very common, and indeed Count is So in a great degree, Monsi de Neste, who w^as a Marquis, and might pretend to any title from his great and ancient family had, in his brevet, when he went to compliment the Czar, Peter the Great; this distinftion. Premier gentil-homme de France, I have heard Several of the best families in Rome never would accept titles. I will conclude this letter with an anecdote concerning Lambertini; which shews hov/ very injurious he thought giving rank, except commanded by merit, was to this city. He had a nephew, a student at Rome ; he called for him, and Said, in the preSence of his tutor. Sir, depend not upon your relation to me ; you came a poor gentleman from Bologna,
and
t 154 1 , -
jmd fuch you will return, if fuperior
merit does not command Superior rank. I believe you will think with me, the Pope’s public Spirit was too rigid. He was So exadt to his word, the young man had no benefice at his uncle’s death, nor many years afterwards. At length a perSon of quality in Bologna (the nephew having nothing bad in his charadter) procured him Some considerable preferment, as a mark of gratitude to the Self-denial of Lambertini. I am.

F HOUGH I have not yet ex-
amined the beauties of all the palaces in the city, to change the Scene, I make little excursions to the villas of the nobility, which adds much to the agre-mens of this place. I will first Speak of the Villa de Medicis, as it is within the walls. The houfe, but for the basso relievos adorning the front towards the garden, would not deServe attention, they are fine ; the remarkable actions of the Romans are the fubjefts. Near the houSe are Several valuable antique statues; and there are Some in an alcove on the right. What calls for the highest admiration, is a groupe of figures
repre-

-representing Niobe and her children, by Praxiteles. The statue of Niobe is esteemed one of the finest ever made ; the proportion is cert^nly exquisite, and the beauty great ; but I have Seen pieces of Sculpture, to me, more pleasing. The gardens are in the state of thoSe whofe proprietors have either wanted taste or fortune to change their form for theSe hundred years : their only advantage is the command of a sine and extensive view of the city. I should except the ornaments, for added to the statues, there is a Small but beautiful obelilk ; I believe Rome has, at least, sifty of theSe ancient monuments. In the apartments of this villa is the little Apollo, and other statues of merit. When I return to England, all jhouSes will appear empty and incom*
pleat, which have not theSe ornaments
or
[' 157 ]
or paintings. Apropos to this fubjedl. you will Soon See the performances of Chriffon, a Frenchman, who not finding encouragement here, propofes ta go to England. What I Saw of the antiquities, I knew gave me reaSon ta conclude, that thofewithwsiomi was acquainted were represented with justice. I think he has merit, and am charmed, to See the beauties of antiquity travel ta England in every form and style. The Villa BorgheSe, in Porta Pinciana, is a Small distance frohi the city ; the entrance is by a handSome portone, over which is a basso relievo, representing a Roman Sacrifice. You have a fine long walk in view; but the verdure has a. pleasing effetst, and the. weather is warnr enough to enjoy that pleaSure, though the SeaSon is So far advanced. The liouSe is Small, and like the Villa de
Me-
[ 158 ]
Medicis, derives its beauty from the rich Sculpture with which it is decorated, and Surpasses the former, in this refpedS, having three Facciate ornamented : the principal has not only basso-relievos, but Several antique statues ; thoSe of Marcus Aurelius, and Marcus Antoninus ; the busts of Trajan and Adrian. The basso-relievos represent various Singular aDions and events, related in the Roman history : The peace between the Romans and. Sabines ; Curtius leaping into the gulph for the preservation of his country : TheSe give great pleaSure in the view, but would not in a relation, at least, by my pen. In the apartments are Some good statues, both antique and modern ; Several basso-relievos, one with Cupid and Venus, SuppoSed to be by Praxiteles ; Bacchus upon a Sepul--	-	chre.

chre, onwshich is engraved the death oV Meleager ; a statue of Agrippina ; the heads of Livia, and Berenice; but I wsill not pretend to give a detail, as I shall only fill my letters with names of objects whoSe beauties I cannot describe, and even of the names my memory may not preSent thoSs most deserving attention. Bernini has many performances in thoSe apartments : his David going to engage Goliah, is esteemed a piece of great merit. When I first came to Rome, I was greatly charmed with a monument in the Madonna della Vittoria, where an angel deScends to Saint TereSa, who is dying. This is the work of Bernini. Now this, and every modern piece ^of Sculpture, want that noble Simplicity, with which the ancient are generally attended. Do not imagine this inclination for antiquity

A most obedient Servant, &c.
Rome.
I have been to See the Roman baths, or rather their remains : their preSent state is Such, they convey no ideas, but thoSe of the vastneSs and grandeur of that nation’s works. Points So well known, it is unnecessary to enlarge upon the Subject, particularly to a per-Son well read in Roman history. It is Some time since father Lafure and Jac-quier left Rome; they are a loSs to all the Societies they frequented. I am far
from
/
[ i6i ]
from being partial to their state ; but I prefer the conversation of an intelligent Monk, to that of an ignorant Prince; and the former has, at least, the merit of being as rare as the latter.. Thefe fathers are gone to Parma : they are appointed preceptors in Mathematics to the Prince of that place. Before they went from this city, the Pope gave them a diSpenSation as to habit, as well as food, theirs being inconvenient to a court-life, as when they were obliged to pay obedience to monastic rules. Rousseau’s observation could not, I believe, be applied to them ; “ the human mind is too limited to embrace every objedh ; the Monks attached and exadt to perform the Minutiae of religion, forget the essential, to be an honest man.’*

LETTER XLVIII.
I SHOULD be happy to employ more time in obeying your commands than my prefent Situation will permit. In Speaking of the amufements in this city, I will begin with, the Lago, not from excellency, but peculiarity. The Piazza Navonna,.. on this occasion, is laid under water about three feet deep, in which the coaches drive with ladies drest as for a ball. Many more behold this diversion, exhibition, or whatever denomination you pleaSe to give, from the ringheras,-’ or balconies.; where they are attended by Abbots, the Petits Maitres of this place. The women were very numerous, and
■ ■ of
[ 1^3 ]
of the first rank ; but I think there is more beauty in the lower claSs, and in this Sentiment I am not Singular. I did not See above two or three girls of fashion; they are, in general, shut up in Convents till a propoSal of marriage is made ; if none is made before a certain age, they are there for life. The extraordinary amuSement I have mentioned, is to be Seen only the four Sundays in August, when the weather is exceffively hot, and the city regarded as unwholeSome ; yet a great many perSons of condition stay in town. I am inclined to think it is only in Some particular quarters of Rome that the air is -bad; where the English lodge, in general, I believe is always Salubrious; the Trinita de Monti is remarkably So; and I conclude, wherever the nobility inhabit, or they would be more dif-M 2	poSed
[ i 54 ]
pofed to a Country life, for which they
appear to have leSs inclination than-
even the French ; perhaps they have
reaSon, after Speaking of the diverSion
in Piazza Navonna, you will think >
Rome is distrest on that head. Here are concerts perpetually. Some balls, and I believe, in the carnival, all Sorts of diversions, from the Opera to Punchinello ; excepting this feafon, I should imagine time must hang heavy upon-' the hands of the inhabitants, though it ® is far otherwise with me : in general they have no taste for the curioSities of the place; nor do they love study, or even books of amuSement. French is lefs understood in this, than any polite city of Europe; very few women, though of the highest^ rank, conversing or reading in that language; which is a loSs ; for notwithstanding
many
’[ 1^5 ]
many nations have more writers of tite first merit; yet, from the French, may she colledled a uSeful and entertaining library ; they, in general, write with precision, and other excellencies advantageous to perSons whoSe inclinations, or capacities do not lead to Superior studies : the English ESs want, and .and are more ready to claim, the assistance of their neighbours than any other nation. The Italians have not a great number, nor variety of authors, but they have Some most excellent; Dant^ Taffo^ and Ariosto. The French cannot pretend to a comparison in heroic poetry : We have Spencer for Ariosto^; ,and Milton Surpasses Tasso ; Dante I understand enough highly to admire, shut perhaps not to do justice by. a de- ' ciSion. The pastoral poetry ofrhe Italians I think excels all others, Though .M 3	J know
[ i66 ]
I know it is not beyond criticifm. In general, the writers of this nation are poets, to whom their language is very advantageous. I believe the Italians are too idle to write, if genius necesi--sity does not command. Th French are the reverSe ; many Scribbl. for pleasure, what none, except themSelves or particular friends, will ever read ; but, in the great numbers. Some Succeed; and this disposition gives an amazing variety of SubjeDs, as well as authors. I read your favorite MetastaSio with greater pleaSure than ever ; though his stile is eaSy, yTt, from a farther knowledge of the pronunciation, there is certainly a great deal in the harmony of the verSe, which this author particularly studied, as he wTote for music. Hasse was always inclined to compofe lor his operas, with lest pay than other
writers i
[ i67 ]
writers; the strong fenSe leading to adequate founds. The Italians, I was going to Say,g (when their poetry took me from my Subjedl) appear, rather diSpofed to learn a language more advantageous than the'French, in point of reading and knowledge, but where they would .find more difficulty, I mean the English; in my opinion the analogy of the British and Italian. charafler is cfreater than that of either of thoSe na-
SD
dons and the French. It is remarkable, though the French very Soon Speak Italian, as- far as is neceffary for uSe, yet, they never arrive at any great perfections : the languages appear to me ana- -logons-lasi i to 1 the formation of the w'ords, not So in the idioms and accent;. this, I should think, must be the rea-Son. How very low the Italian comic writers are at preSent, Goldoni, is a M 4	proof i
[ i6S ]
proof; for he is read, and I have, heard the representation was applauded. Indeed an author for the Theatre, tho* he may strengthen and heighten his charadlers, must, in comedy, draw from life. Moliere’s works were, and are yet, in a great degree, the charadleriS-tics of his nation ; much, and variety of ridicule in the people in general, their share of vice, as far as it is in the Sphere of a comic writer to reprefent, and, at the fame time. Some charadlers, whoSe wit, knowledge, and virtue, do honor to thehuman race. There is apo-» verty of charadter amongst the preSent Romans (I have heard the Same with regard to the Italians in general) not from any defedl in genius ; for they appear in this, as in former ages, to receive much from nature. You may See in the children, though lively, a
Sedate-
[169]
Sedatenefs and refiebfion, which, if properly applied and cultivated, must produce great and good effects ; but unhappily for them, this sine, natural genius degenerates from a defedt in education, and the contracted circle in which it is obliged to adt. The understanding is principally exerted in caballing for private interests ; no wonder it should it be So, where the pretensions to the highest rank, and most Sacred , office, are decided by no other means than a Superior cabal. Public Spirit shews its head in France, though it ^ is obliged to caution ; here it makes no attempt. Much time is given to gallantry, when not inconsistent with affairs ; and here, as in the French nation, they endeavour to unite them. ThcSe dispositions are So strong, thoSe who have no particular perSon to en-'	I
D D 5
[ 170 ]
gage, nor are concerned in church preferments, find the conversation very insipid. My opinion in this point could have no .weight ; but it is the Sentiment of many, that have much fre- ^ quented them. A considerable perSon of a .northern court, who preSented himSelf at one of the first assemblies, in all reSpedts declared he had the utmost difficulty to stay the time politeneSs Te-quired, the conversation turning entirely upon promotions in the church,' ■ and other topics, in v/hich it was impossible for any but the parties immec diately concerned to be interested. I have been in company With Some Italians, who were esteemed wits ; but I think they owed that distindtion to their Society, with whopi they were compared; at least they must appear in that light to thoSe who have had the
honor
[ '71 ]
honor of conversing with Mr. Grey, and other perSons of Superior genius in England ; a happy and free government not only Secures the greater bleS-lings of life, but gives birth to wit, humor, and every agreement of conversation. Perhaps I have made this observation already, and I am perSuaded thousands have made it before me; but you must pardon the repetition of a Sentiment So natural; and to which • all I hear, and every objedl I See, contributes. I am afraid you will think me as tedious as the northern minister did the Italian converSazione. Take the advantage, throw my'letter aside, or burn it ; but let mie first tell you I am, v/ith the greatest esteem and reSpeD,

P. S. Tho’ you may feel ennuy at the Italian converSazioni, you will not have that opportunity at their tables; in this point the French much SurpaSs them ; added to thoSe who, from their jilaces, have appointments from the court to entertain. Every gentleman who pretends to figure, has both an 'Clegant and hoSpitable houSe.

Before you enter the apartments, are vast numbers of fine antique statues, Some ancient tombs,

Surpasses much, in real value, the paintings ; though not in the Same degree pleasing to me, at least not So striking.. The basso - relievos illustrate many events in ancient history, and their figurative expression attests the luxuriant and elevated genius ©f the authors. I could amuSe mySdf for weeks in,reading

ing the emblematical writings upon ! Ibme of the antique Sepulchres. I have ' Seen this colleDion but once, the next ‘ time will take notes. It is a common observation. Great wits have short memories ; in Some reSpetsta I believe they may : having a genius fertile in raising ideas, renders them inattentive to thoSe exterior objeDs in general preSent, and of their own, the Succession is So quid:, the irripression cannot be strong. I am t going from what I have Said, to draw an excuSe for my want of memory ; though the cauSe is very different, mine proceeding from the great genius of others, theirs from their own ; but the effed is | the Same. The vast number and variety of objects at the Cainpidoglio, oc-' casioned Such a quick Succession of ideas, they have left, though a very strong general impression, that of particulars
[ m 3
ticulars very weak: for this reaSon 1 will leave them at preSent, not -^ithout gratitude to Lambertipi for the amuSe-ment of the day, and the pleaSmg resiedions which will frequently ariSe. The Romans, ever desirous of a new Pope, Regard an election as tste great holiday of the city. I am per-Suaded they loSt the excellent perSon above-mientioned without concern ; though they have much regret he is not now alive. As for the Pontiff, who at preSent sills the throne, he had a trifling cold, and the hopes of all Rotpe were raiSed to the highest degree ; a conclave was the Subject: of coiiverSa-tion, and the great number of strangers who would attend the event. I remember once heftring Some French ob-ferve their votes were of no conSe-quence on this occasion; for the Italians VoL. II.	N	alw.ays

always outwitted, or rather conquerecS them by falSehood; the latter is very extraordinary: where the honor of a '' Frenchman is concerned, I would depend upon his veracity, but as that is not even fiippofed to enter into political affairs, the Italians do wonders if they make a drawn battle. I can easily conceive they furpaSs the French in Secrecy and silence, points very consequential in the bufineSs of a conclave.
The French certainly have a great talent for discerning Sentiments by countenances : the Italians as great in concealing them. The vanity of the for- | mer lays them open to thoSe who desire to penetrate their Schemes; pride is more reServed. I have been assured, in a meeting of Cardinals, Some of whom were Transalpine, the principal topic was the merits of French and Italian • ■,	pomatum.

^pomatum. Though I know the Spirit of trifling' is great in one nation (of the other I am not So good a ]udge) yet I I must SuppoSe a fear of diScovering-their Sentiments on more consequential Subjects gave riSe to this. Whatever 'Was the motive, the conversation was foolifli enough, but a better employment much for their geniuSes,than when engaged in Sending sire and Sv/ord all -over Europe, and making acts, almost • „as abSurd, though not So innocent as Boileau’s BurleSque Arret, from Par-naffus, in favor of the Aristotelian principles.

celebrated captains ; in the other, of philosophers^ poets, and rhetoricians. On the right is a grove, on the left a little ap rtment, whoSe roof is Supported by two large pillars, one an entire piece of flowered alabaster. Here are Several balfo-relievos, and many learned curiosities of antiquity: to this is joined a Small Ionic teihple, which makes a very beautiful peripeifiive to the grand portico; the deity is an Lphe-sian Diana. On the other side of the houSe is a Semicircular portico, embellished, or rather enriched, with rsiahy statues ; one of Theban alabaster, much larger than the Site : this, ^ith regard to the Substance, is the finest, and most curious, I ever Saw ; the figure of the deity reprefented, is equally horrid and ridiculous, as Egyptish divinities in general are : that nation cbiild

riot be acciifed of idolizing beauty; had they been as free from every other kind of idolatry, they would better have de-Served their reputation of wiSdom. True religion is for all the world, riot to be confined to a few misticks, or initiated. The gardens are neither large nor fi'iie, except as they are ornarrierit-fed with statues, fountains, and all the curioSities, and imitations of antiquity, agsteeable to the place. The preferit "Cardinal Albani, who is a great virtuoso, built arid beautified this houSe arid arid villa, which was a vineyard; I think his eminence bould krieVer intend it as a habitation; in that light it is better adapted to pigmies than Romans ; if he only propbSed to shew his taste, the SucceSs is anSwerable to his iriteri-tion. I have been riiore particular than 2	ufual
[ ]
uSual in my description, as I shall* not revisit this villa ; a day is much here, as a month at the Colonna palace, Vatican, or Campidoglio; the sight was alone pleaSed this day ; the mind had not exerciSe enough to be even^^content. From hence I will go to the modern, particularly portrait painters ; in my way I will mention Mr. Hamilton, though that is not the first point of view in which hens to be considered ; his merit is principally in historical pieces. He has no great finished painting in his houie at preSent; the death of Lucretia is not far enough advanced for me to form any judgment from the SucceSs he has hitherto had in pidlures of that style, I should imagine this will be considerable. Battoni is generally esteemed the first forshis portraits; the reSemblances
are
t >87 ]
are strong and striking, I think they are very often caricaturas : I Saw Some of my acquaintance, to whom he had, by no means, done justice. He had one piece very fine; but there were circumstances attending, which gave a merit beyond a common portrait, and he had Succeeded in highly marking the requisite expression. Battoni has Several historical pidtures much esteemed, in Rome, and Some, I conclude you have Seen in England. From Battoni I went to Maron, where I found my acquaintance better treated. As a meer portrait painter (and I do not know he attempts a higher merit) I think Maron deServes to be ranked in the first claSs ; the resemblances he takes are both strong and pleasing, yet not flattering. Indeed I do not See why a Frenchman
may
I ]
may not equal an Italian in this brands of tlife art ; I have obfervedv other occasions, they have great quicknefs, astd JiistneSs of sight, with a most extraordinary faculty of imitation; and for every other point requisite to excellency in theSe performances ; thofe who study in Italy may acquire them, and have the’ Same advantage of the light in this country ; though I should imagine that is not So neceffary for this style of jiainting, as landSchapes, and where-eVPt a delicacy eff perSpedlive makes a gtestt part of the beauty of the pidure. I have Seen Some sine portraits by Mig-nafd, and other celebrated painters in France by accident, but never Sought fat them, as however great their perfec-tkm may be, they have rto merit, nor are otherwise antusing, than one is acquainted

Nor did I ever hear Englishmen accuSed of being inScnSible to Italian beauty. If we have no models at home, we Seek and study theirs in all the arts and Sciences for which they are celebrated. We do not, like the French, pretend to have a music of our own, but court and imitate the Italian. As to living models, though the English faces may vie with any, and furpaSs most in exquisite complexion, and delicacy of features, they have not So generally, the vivacity and expressiveness of the Italian countenances, yet without being leSs agreeable. But when I consider to wdiom I am addressing mySelf, I can easily allow', that

LETTER LI,
I AM this moment returned from viewing the triumphal arches; as I imagined, that at Orange has prevented* any great effedS, though perfeDly plain, and tlieSe very much ornamented. I SuppoSe the circumstances in wdiich the arch at Orange w^as ereested, did not
permit thoSe embellishments, leiSurc,-and the Science ofthe capital gave here
"or
L >9“ ]	,
or if it ever had any decorations, time has destroyed them. The arch at O* range has ^he advantage of being the only noble objedl for Some leagues'; in Rome the eye is accustomed to great-^ neSs. If my pleaSure did not rife very high with regard to theSe pieces of antiquity, in general, I had a Singular and,exquisite Satisfaction in beholding the arch' of Titus. Every monument of this excellent Emperor, is a justice rendered to his Superior virtue, and at the Same time preSents the most perfet^b model to Succeeding princes. I have often reflected with astonifliment. Kings should be So generally complimented by the name of Augustus, and Seldom by that of Titus : I fear more have been like the former, than the latter ; but truth does not determine the panegyrist : therefore I conclude it is the
‘ fame
[ 193 ]
fame given to Augustus by the poets. Yet Sure the Delicite generis humanis, from the voice of the people, is more glorious than ail the praiSe which flattery can invent. What a Superiority, in every reSpeft, has Titus over Augul-tus ! I'he former received his power from virtue, Succession, and election ; the latter from an uSurpation, favoured by the friends of his uncle, and Secured by the most conSummate cruelty, as long as that vile quality was convenient, when clemency became more So ; for this, and no other, reaSon he uSurp-cd that virtue, as he had done the throne. How different Titus, every action of his life proclaimed ; and when, with tears, he faid, I have ioSc a day, he might, with justice. Scorn all other praiSe. The magic power of poets may raiSe a sstadow where there VoL. II..	O	is;
[ 194 ]
is no SubStance, as for Augustus. Fh tus required not their art ; he knew, if even the thought was not beneath his greatneSsj p.ffessing virtue herSelf, fame, whom others courted, must follow him, to her I leave thoSe here, and go to the Colloffeum ; this amphitheatre is larger than that at NiSmes, having had feats for fourScore thou Sand, the other twenty ; the building is likewiSe more elegant ; yet the remains at NiSmes being much greater, the effedl is higher, and a better idea conveyed.—This moment I receive a letter, which calls me to England : I propoSed infinite pleasure from the music of the holy week, and a farther indulgence, and improvement of my taste for paintings and antiquities ; but, as I am returning to your Society, I shall be much more compensated for all the agremens and
bcautieS:
I 195 ]
beauties I leave at Rome. The most ' pleasing sight that can engage attention, is a beautiful face; and the most exquisite harmony, the voice of her one loves. With theSe Sentiments, in a higher degree, and with greater Sensibility than La Bruyere ever possessed them, I am,
Madam,
Your most obedient, and
Rome,
Most humble Servant.
