To The 
HONOURABLE 
Richard Fitz Williams, Esq;

SIR, 
I must confess I am some
thing at a loss when I 
consider the usual Me-
thod of Dedicators who 
when they have finish'd 
their Works, pitch upon a 

[The Epistle]
Patron to whom they may 
ascribe all the Vertues of 
their Hero; or make him 
an Instance ٥f all the Per-
fection and Excellencies of
that Piece; by this com-
mon Judgement of Dedica-
tions, a hasty Reader may
be apt to think, I affront
my Patron, by engaging
him in the defence of a 
Book wherein I have en
deavoured to set off the 
Baseness and Ingratitude of 
some Men in their proper 
Colours; hereby making 

[Dedicatory.]
all Mankind my Enemies;
for Strangers will look upon
it as a Satyr leveld at the 
whole Sex, and my Friends 
be dissatisfy’d with the Pro-
tection of what seems writ
against themselves, and 
ought rather to be laid 
at the Feet of some disconso-
late Lady: But the con-
trary will soon appear, and
that 'twas this very Consi-
deration made me pitch up-
on you, as the only Man 
whose Vertues I could op
pose to the Vices of Cory-

[The Epistle] 
don; thereby shewing the 
World I did not involve
the whole Sex in his Guilt;
for how many Crimes so-
ever I made him guilty of, 
I make sufficient amends by 
giving an Instance of twice 
as many Vertues in you. 

Cordon's Conquests were 
not rais'd like other Hero’s, 
upon the Foundation, or by 
force of his Noble Exploits, 
but rather by die Practises
of a Subtle Man upon a 
Credulous Woman, and

[Dedicatory.]
the growth of his Success 
has been influenced only by 
a seeming Greatness, which 
ferv’d to dazle the Eyes of 
the weak sightedm and lead 
them astray from the Paths 
of Vertue: but, Sir, who 
ever would pursue those He-
roick Paths leading to true 
Honour, need no longer be 
at a loas for a Noble Guide, 
if they know you. 

Having thus, in some
measure, remov'd the Ob
jections that but too readi-

[The Epistle]
ly offer’d themselves against 
any reception this poor 
Piece might expect from 
Men, and given some Rea-
ons for my choosing you 
in particular, as the most fit 
Person, whose Noble Ge-
nerosity might afford a se
cure Retreat and safe Re-
fuge to the distress’d Clarin-
da, give me leave, Sir, to 
acquaint you also with the 
Reasons, why above all 
People in the World, 
she should find that Protection 
she desires in you.  

[Dedicatory.]
'Tis Title enough to the 
Protection of a Noble Ge-
nerous Soul, to stand realy 
in need of it: The poor 
Clarinda certainly has this 
Plea, and as for your part, 
Sir, you are not now to be 
distinguish’d. She was be-
tray’d by a Man Base and 
Ungrateful, one whose Per-
son, with borrowed Lustre
and affected Charms, in-
snar'd her Heart; but she’s 
now introduc’d to a Man of 
real Worth, one whose 

[The Epistle]
Mind is illustrated with
Vertue, the Beauty and 
Majesty of which can't so 
much as be thought of 
without Love and Venera-
tion:In Short, to recover 
that good Opinion of Man-
kind which she lost by Co-
rydon, 'tis necessary she be 
acquainted with you, nor 
need she fear a cold Recep-
tion, where Honour and 
Affability make their con-
stant Residence. 

[Dedicatory.]
To Conclude, Sir, in
your favourable Entertain-
ment, she is more happy 
than if she never had been 
otherwise, and the Good-
ness you Universally diffuse
upon all who have the good 
Fortune to be near you, can't
but swetten the remainder
of her Days, though the 
Cause of her Grief be ne-
ver so great. May all Man-
kin join as heartily in con-
tributing what they can to 
your happiness, as they do 

[The Epistle, &c.]
in a just Admiration of you;
and may this, and every new 
Year, augment the Blessings 
of the past, which are the 
Wishes of, Sir,  

your most Obedient
Humble Servant,

LETTERS 
From a 
NOBLE Lord
To His
Mistress؛ 
Under the Borrow’d Names of 
Corydon and Clarinda. 

Letter I. 
To Corydon. 

O Thou Treasyre of my Soul!
Life of my Life! what shall I 
call thee? what Epithet find tender
enough to express my unequall'd 

(2)
Fondness? My poor trembling heart
(a young Practitioner in these Affairs, 
and only taught by you) doubts eve-
ry Expression, left it want power; or 
to reveal my Flames, or keep yours
ever burning. Be still, thou trusting 
Flatterer, he will be always mine: he 
is too Noble, too Generous, to betray; a
nd I am happy, happy above my 
Sex: One piercing Look or falling 
Accent from his charming Tongue, 
gives greater Bliss than all the stupid 
World can know; one soft hour of 
melting Love outweighs the Loss of 
Parents, Family, and Fame. 

Oh, my loved Lord, why did the 
created Powers form thee sb divine!
each aiding Angel lend a Grace to fi-
nish the bright work, and stamp the 
glorious Heroe supernatural. Oh, I 
rave! and fixing all my Heaven on 
thee, my doting Love grows up to 
Adoration. 

You bid me write of my Self, my 
Health, if I liked my Solitude, and 
each minute Particular: Alas! how c
an I descend from Extasies to Tri-

(3)
fles not worth my care! but you
commanded, and I obey. The Place
pleases me as much as I desire to be
pleased when Absence renders taste-
less even the Coriveniencies of Life 
and Joys much more. I shun all Com-
pany; their Assiduities are lost on
one so wrapt in though as I: my
only Questions are, When the Post 
comes in? how often I may fend? 
Oh write to me, my Corydon (for so
I think you gave me leaver to call ye)
write to me quickly lest I grow mad 
with thinking, lest Grief destroys
those Charms you have so often sworn
Clarinda does possess, which I preserve
alon for you. Oh give me a Letter
that I may read it o'er and o'er a 
thousand times, kiss it, blush at my
Folly, put i in my Bosom, and call
it for I wou'd have it very You. 
Let it be only Turh, sure Turth 
and You are one. What do you do 
at Court? How pass your Evenings
now after the Duty o'er? Tell me all, 
be just like me, and then you never 
will know when to end. 

(4) 
Oh those dying Eyes! at parting, 
how often has the dear Reflection re-
newed the killing Transports? Well, y
ou love me, I am sure you do; and w
ith that pleased Thought I leave ye, 
Farervel. Yet I muit go on: Oh love 
and pity me. Now־ adieu. Wou’d 
you had heard that Sigh. Adieu.

LETTER II. 
Corydon to Clarinda. 

Yours, my charming Clarinda, I 
receiv’d at One this Morning, 
having just left my Lord --- and the 
Marquis of --- at the Rummer, with 
whom I drank your Health: The 
Toast was every Man's Inclination, 
and you was mine by Jove; a thous-
and times I wish’d you present, 
so contriv’d, as to appear invisible to all 
but me: then I grew uneasy with 
my Company, all their Discourses 
were impertinent, and each returning 
Glass became as nauseous as the Em-
braces of a Woman in the absence of 
my lov’d Clarinda wou'd be to 
Corydon. Your Letter, my Dear, I
read it o’er and o’er, and printed 
Kisses on every Line; and when it 
blush’d, poor Rogue, I hid it in 
my Bosom, and then methought it 
whisper’d, as I remember you some-

(6)
times wou'd, My Life! my Corydon! 

The Devil take, Custom; were it 
not for that, you might be here with
me, or I there with you, and no no-
tice taken. Why shou'd Generous 
Souls be fetter'd to the dull Rules of 
Custom? Nothing but Customs makes 
a Crime; and Fools are still the most 
censorious. A curse on their prying
Curiosity. I can let Tradesmen cheat, 
Parsons get drunk, and Wives Cuckold 
their Husbands, without the least 
Concern; then why should the busie 
World disturb our Loves? But no 
matter; I hope a little time will re-
inflate us in our former Tranquillity. 
I doubt not but when you are known 
to, be in the Country, Fame, who 
very often errs, will be thought to 
have bely'd you. i٠m sure if Lovers 
have any Friends above, your Repu-
tation will be their Care. Oh how I
ahou's rejoyce to see that day when
we might hourly meet with frequent 
Opportunities of renewing our fierce 
Embraces, when we might give our 
selves over to Loving, not fear the 

(7)
watchful jealous eye. Believe me,
Clarinda, I have tasted no real Joy 
since you left me, nor is it possible I 
shou’d till you return. I’m glad to
find you like your Solitude; for that's
a friend to Love. My Dear, I can-
not tell you how I spend my time, 
only this, that I’m sure I pass none 
so pleasantly as that in Writing to
you. I am all Extasie when I think
on thee,, and that’s every moment; 
nay, I break forth in very Poetry:

Oh, in what Raptures did I lately burn!
Now, with what Anguish I your Absence 
mourn! 
Think of those Joys believe these Pains,
and then. 
Forget me, dead Clarinda, if you can.
No, thou blest Angel of my Eyes and
Soul! 
Nothing thy constant Faith can e'er 
remove, 
This Thought does ev'ry anxious Doubt 
controul, 
And joins my Heart to thine in bonds 
of mutual Love٠ 
 
(8) 
So may just Heav'n its Blessngs deal 
to me, 
As I perform the Vows I've made to 
thee. 

Thus, my Dear, I conclude; and 
beg you to be content, and rest as 
certain of my Love as of the return-
ing Day; and believe, you never 
shall have cause to love less 

Your Faithful 
Corydon. 

(9)
LETTER III 
Clarinda to Corydon. 

If after mad Impatiencies, furious 
Wishes, and wild Desires, when 
the Blessing is receiv’d I shou’d chide 
my Corydon, wou'd he not think it
strange? yet so I must: Your Letter 
bears too loose a Style for my Heroick 
Love; with more Care and greater S
tudy you made your first Approach-
es to my virgin-heart. Oh Corydon! 
what a Curse is this on Womankind! 
Your Dotage is all before a Conquest, 
Ours begin when you are Bankrupts. 
How came I to say that, the farthest 
from my Thoughts? Cou'd I believe 
thy vast stock of Love does or will
receive the least Decay? The bare 
Apprehension would kill me, and 
Death’s fatal Stroke prevent some 
greater Ruin. 

Remember, Corydon, you cannot 
have forgot it; yet I'll repeat the 

(10)
pleasing Story: The Image always
fills nay Mind, each Beauty strove to 
captivate my Corydon, and every Dart 
was aimed at you; my Eyes alone 
avoided you; I heard your Praises 
all the Day, your God-like Mein and 
glorious Actions; I fear’d your Pow-
er, and stood upon my Guard; found 
your Design; for 1 ne’er look’d up 
but I beheld you fixrupon my Face; 
or ir you came near in the Crowd, 
where daily we see each other, how 
wou’d you sigh! and when by any 
accident your hand was offeredm, it 
trembled so, that I changed Colour 
too. These were the publick Signs 
of Love : but oh! at length, with 
never-ceasing Diligence tracing my 
Steps with endless Care, Corydon 
found me alone in the Closet of the ---
What did you then? Down at my 
feet the lovely Hero fell, and cry’d, 
inhumane Fair, What do you mean 
by perfecting thus your Slave? If 
your Resolve is Hate, end with my 
Life my Sufferings; for whilst I live, 
I must, I will pursue you with my 

(11)
Love. Say, Corydon, was I nor dis-
creet? I broke from thy Arms which 
graspt my Knees, without one Sylla-
ble in answer, and fled to my Com- 
panions, who asked me if I had seen
a Ghost, my Surprize was such; you 
followed, saw the pale Confusion, and
better skill’d than poor unwary I, 
made, I fear, a too kind Construction:
then, My Lord, what pains you took
to make a Friendship wherever I did, 
that I could visit no where but I found 
my Corydon.

This gave you frequent Opportu-
nities; and 'twas at my dear Lucina's
Apartments first I heard with patience 
what you had to say: and oh! when 
Women listen to the softening Tale of 
Love, like parlying Towns besieged, 
they seldom fail the wish’d Sur-
render. 

What am I doing, foolish Creature!
Why does this lov’d Remembrance of 
my past Weakness hang on my Pen? 
Well, I have done. 

Now hear the Difference of our p
resent Lives. You are in the midst 

(12)
of all your Friends, in the midst of 
all Diversions; 1 banish'd from all, 
knowing no living Creature but my 
Woman, desiring no Companion but 
my Book, cherishing no Thoughts 
but those of thee: if I walk, inquisi-
tive Gazers watch me: then reclused 
I never peep abroad, such is my So-
litude. But my Love will come and 
chear me; there’s another Hope to 
strengthen my Courage when I must 
pronounce that melancholly Word 
Adieu. 

(13)
LETTER IV. 
Corydon to Clarinda.

Why all these Doubts and Fears, 
my Love? Why this needless 
Repetition? Does my Clarinda think 
I am grown so stupid, so lifeless, for 
so I must be when I forget the least
Particular of what has past between 
us, those soft Embraces, moaning Sighs 
and melting Tears, which were too 
precious to fall unobferv’d, are still 
fresh in the Memory of Corydon. What 
shall I say more? I think there is no-
thing more of consequence to say, ex-
cept I entertain you with Truths ob-
vious to every eye; as, that 'tis Day 
when the Sun shines, and when he’s 
gone ’tis Night; or, that I love you 
dearer than all the Women in the 
World, as great a Truth as either of 
the former, and ought to be as well 
known to you. For my part, I think 
the telling of this over and over, as

(14)
some Men do their Passions, ought 
to be tiresome to Women of your Ni-
cety, and as nauseous to the Mind, 
as Meat often drest to the Stomach: 
for to be always in the high Road of 
making Love, a Man must Bake, 
Boil, Roail, Hash, and Mince his
Love, to find Variety for his Mistress, 
who perhaps does not think, because 
'tis brought warm to her it has so 
often been cool'd by another, and on-
ly soft up again for her Palate. These 
common Practises of Love ought to
be below a Woman Of your Sense, 
whose Delicacy shou'd relish a Plate 
(tho no bigger than a Saucer) of 
something new, above those vast Dish-
es of repeated Cramb. I am now in 
haste, being just going to wait upon 
the King; yet you see I prefer Love 
to all, and stay to write this long 
Letter, when it might be easie for me 
to tear what I have done, then tell 
you wittily, this Letter is an Emblem 
of my Heart rent and torn for you ---
Meer trifling, and ought no more to 
pass for Love than Childrens Toys 

(15)
for Riches, or a gilded lump of base 
Metal for true Sterling. There’s 
something JB true Love distinguish- 
able from affected Passions, something 
of Excellence which can’t be discern'd 
but by a Trial that the Counterfeit 
can’t undergo, an intrinsick Value 
that has something more than Gild-
ing or Varnish to set it off؛ and such
is mine for you. Tho' w must la-
ment the Misfortune of being parted, 
My Dear, yet remember we are to 
meet again with the greater Pleasure. 
The Tears, 'tis true, were on your
side only; but believe me, I had my 
share of Trouble too: and give me 
leave to tell my dear Clarinda, that 
she chides Without reason; for if she 
confider'd, she would find it impossi-
ble that a Man in Public Business, 
as I am, can exempt my self from
Company always. For my part, I 
drag my self from one place to ano-
ther, and meet with frequent Occasi-
ons of being Uneasie, but then the 
Thoughts of you, My Dear, and of
your Love, relieves my weary Mind;

(16) 
for sure I may endure a troublesome 
World as long as I am happy in you, 
who to me is the best Delight it. 
Nature made such dear, soft, enga-
ging Creatures as you to reconcile 
that part of Mankind that can de-
serve you by loving you to the Dis-
quiet of the World; it would scarce 
be worth our while to live else. Ye-
sterday I paid a Visit to my Lady ---
out of respect to you My Dear, and 
for the sake of an Opportunity to talk 
of her who employs all my Thoughts. 
She was very inquisitive, what was 
become of you, and said a thousand 
kind things of you, and press me ve-
ry hard to know how to write to 
you; but I did؛ not tell her, nor will, 
till I have a Commission from you to 
do so. From thence I took a Walk 
over the Park, where I ran over in 
my Mind everything that pleases me 
in you; your Fondness, that, is irre-
sistibly engaging, and appears unde-
sign’d; your faithful Love, that I am 
convinc’d will never alter; the pretty 
things you say, and those you write, 

(17)
and those thousand Charms that pos-
sess every part of you; in short, My 
Dear, you are the Book I study now, 
and I will not quit you to range after 
any imaginary Pleasure or sordid Pro-
fit. I cannot tell why Love, which is 
the most Natural, as well as Noblest 
Passion, shou’d not fit our Minds for 
the best things: it enlarges the Soul, 
and I fancy my self better in several 
respects, as well as happier, since I 
knew you whom I love so dearly, so
dearly, that, even you can hardly love 
me fo much; and nothing in my life 
ever pleas’d me so well as my loving 
you. Redouble, redouble, Amour une 
peine si chere. Adieu, my Love, I 
shall expect a Letter from you next 
Post; and pray believe that I am----
Sure I am ---- Yours entirely. 

Since I writ this I received both 
the Enclosed; which I send in hopes they 
may divert my solitary Dear، Adieu.

(18)
LETTER  V.
Lucina to Corydon.

My Lord,
In spite of your Denials, I have a
little airy Damon traces your Acti-
ons even into your very Cabinet: 
now this Familiar credibly informs 
me, you know how to send a Letter 
to my Clarinda, I'll take the Ghost's 
Word for a thousand Pound, there-
fore pray do not fail. 

(19)
LETTER VI 
Lucina to Clarinda. 

Thou little Thief thou! first you 
steal the Heart we all coveted, 
but that I forgive you; then you 
steal your self away; a Crime to 
Friendship I cannot pardon. They 
tell us you are. in the North; the
World believes it: but those Disgui-
ses are too thin for one who loves like 
me. I read in Corydon's Triumphant 
Eyes a better Fate than your Absence 
at that Distance in that cold Region; 
and rigid Relations wou'd be no Friends 
to the deity he adores. Dear 
Clarinda, by our past Vows ever-
lasting Friendship, let me hear from 
thee; for all the Court and World is 
insipid to me since you have left it. 
Write to me, My Dear, because I
would not have the adorable Clarinda
justly call’d ungrateful, which she 
must be if she forgets so faithful a 
Friend as Lucina.  

(20)
LETTER VII 
Clarinda to Corydon.

Your Pacquet came seasonably to 
wake me out of some melan-
cholly Reflections which Conquer my 
Resolves against 'em, and too often 
seize my Soul, nay they begin to 
have an Effect upon my Body; nor 
will my Youth, and that strong Cor-
dial Love, long preserve the Jewel 
Health; but your Letter has rous’d 
the darling Passion, and now I feel no 
Pain: Charming Pleasures shrill thro'
my Veins, and Tides of Joy chear 
my beating Heart. 

I am also pleased and surprised at 
my Lucina's Letters; and be assured, 
My Lord, our Visiting her infinitely 
obliges me; for if ever true Friend-
ship possest the Hearts of Women, 
the Sacred Guest is lodged in ours.

Yet so nice my Notions are of 
Love, I denied my seif any Joy but 

(21)
what you create: forbear conversing
with that precious, peculiar, only va-
lued Friend, left the little God should 
be offended if I took one Thought
from him: but her kind Reproach, 
and your Encouragement, have revi-
ved Friendship’s Ardour toward that 
charming fair one. I have writ 
to her, and lent you the Copy, for I was 
ashamed (My Souls Bliss) to let it go 
thro’ your hands, tho’ ’tis to my 
dearest Friend. I shall grow bolder.
I do remember well, when first I gave 
my Corydon leave to write, how I 
trembled at the wish'd Receipt: My 
Spirits fired my Face with Blushes, 
then sunk into pale Confusion; and
tho’ alone, long I feared to break the 
Seals. Now advanced in Courage I 
write to thee; I call thee Life and 
Soul, and all those fond Words I used 
to blush to read. I prithee do not 
give it so harsh a Name as Chiding, 
when I tell my Fears. The Merchant 
whose rich Vessel is at Sea, if all his 
Treafure’s there, does he not dread a 
Storm? You are my only Treasure; 

(22) 
Tempest or Allurements may ruin 
helpless me; the serene Face of Beau-
ty, or the Frowns of Power, each 
wou’d destroy my Peace. Oh wou'd
my Hero quit the glorious Pomp and 
Dangers of the Court for my calm 
Harbour, for Solitude and me, how 
many various ways I’d find to charm! 
Sometimes, like the Arcadian Nymphs, 
I'd range the Groves and Plains, whilst 
flowry Chaplets crown’d my flowing 
Hair: sometimes! Oh Fool! this is 
Romantick all, as old Proper foes the 
Day-dreams of a Maid in Love. You 
are fix'd in Glory’s Circle. I sunk, 
never more, I fear, to rise; no mat-
ter, give to the Ambitious Honour, 
to Church-men Luxury and Power, 
to Misers Wealth, to fighting Kings 
War and Conqueit, to poor Clarinda 
your eternal Love, and my Reward 
exceeds all theirs. You bid me write 
next Post; you see I do. Next, and 
every Post, I pray do you remember, 
and fear not, your 
Clarinda.

(23)
LETTER, VIII.
Clarinda to Lucina.

The Lunatick, my dear Lucina,
flies all Humane Conversation; 
and that is best; for Follies that are 
incurable should not be exposed: But 
you. that take the pains to search a 
wretch that owns her self possest, what 
must you expect from her destracted 
thoughts? Reason I have banish’d, 
and then you’ll guess what I am a 
Slave to. My Letters will be only 
filled with Ravings, still hinting at the 
cause, the lovely cause, that will ex-
cuse me, that must excuse me to Lu-
cina. She knows his Charms, has 
heard his Vows, and often whisper-
ed Pitty to my yielding Soul. Oh be 
kind to him and me! see him often, 
and sometimes talk of her who al-
ways thinks of you, and whom you 
will ever find the truest of her Sex. 

(24) 
Love and Friendship are the Idols of 
Clarinda's Heart.

LETTER IX.
Corydon to Clarinda.

Sure Heaven has no pity for us 
that Love! If it had, we should
not have been parted thus long. I 
had flown to your Arms ere this, if 
the curst Clog of business had not hin-
der’d. Let me beg of you to be con-
tended for a little time, and you shall 
see I will contrive somew ay that we 
may be almost always together. Did 
you but know the impatience I am 
under when I am from you, it would 
as much convince you of my Love, 
as the pleasure I take when I am with 
you, which is not to be counterfeited. 
Ask your own Heart, whether it does 
not think I am in earnest in what I 
say to you; sure it is so much my 
secret Friend, that it will tell you I 

(25)
love you. I will certainly be with 
you the beginning of next Week, and
lye a Night where you please to dis-
pose of me. I hope you have per-
fectly recover’d your Journey, which
I call the Pilgrimage of Love. I am 
in torment for every pain my Dear
feels. By thy Mouth,, thy hair, thy 
Eyes, and every other Charm, I con-
jure thee to take care of thyself. Be 
easie and contented, secure of my 
Love and of every thing that is in 
my Power. Oh, thou hast melted 
my Soul and I shall never forget thee. 
Could you be so kind to quit all for 
me? Can you deny your self all o-
ther Pleasures for those few that, are 
in my Power to give? Can you for-
get the Splendor of a Court for me? 
I know you can do all this; and in 
return, l can only say I love you. Next 
Week, nay, the beginning of next 
Week, we shall meet, my dear Life. 
Can there' be a transport fancied 
greater, when I shall press those Lips 
and wander over that world of beau-
ty. Since we parted how dully: does 


(26)
time move on? But vve must learn to 
bear absence, tho’ we can never make 
it easie to us. Separation will always 
be, as Cowly says of Life, an incura-
ble Disease. How do you spend your 
time now, my Dear? Let me know 
how, you generally divide the Day, 
that I may sometimes have the plea-
sure of thinking what you are doing, 
so apt are we to be mistaken in our 
Judgement of our selves, we do not 
know the Force of our Passions till 
we have the experience of their 
strength. I wish any Man could draw 
the Temper and Dispositions of my 
Mind, as well as the Completion and 
Features of my Face, then you should 
have a Piture of that, my Dear, where-
in you should see my love to you 
had taken a full possesion of my Heart, 
and that, that govern’d every other 
Passion. I have just now been read-
ing over all your Letters to me, and 
I find it is a good way to move and 
enerease the love that lies in the Heart; 
and therefore,, my Dear, I enjoin you 
to read over, all mine, from the first

(27) 
1 ever writ to you to the last, and 
put ’em into the order of time they 
were writ in; and then, My Dear, 
run over in your mind all the mosr
remarkable Passages that have hap-
pen’d since we knew one another: 
and whatsoever has shewn my fond-
ness to you most, think upon 
that most. Thus, My Dearest, do I with 
you; thus I confirm my self in that 
Passion which is already fixed in my 
Heart. You may believe me, My 
Dear, I have minded no Pleasure since 
you left me, but thought perpetually 
of you; and io I wou’d have you do 
of me; and as a proof of my Love, I 
am desirous you shou’d love me. Had 
I an Indifference for you, I should 
not care whether you lov’d me or 
not: but I hope I shall never live to 
see that day, I ihali mention your 
pretty Letter, My Dear, to Lucinda 
with whom I am to sup to Night. 
I go with greater Satisfaction since I 
have your Leave to visit her; for 
believe me, My Dear, were it not 
for your sake, I did not care if 

(28)
there were not such a thing as a Fe-
male in the World, so indifferent I 
am grown for all the Sex but You; 
by Gad I am, believe me, love me, 
and I am happy. Adieu bewitching 
Charmer. 

(29) 
LETTER X.
Clarind to Corydon.

My Corydon, 
Never was I fo frighted as when 
I read your lassi charge you 
by all our Loves, by all you hold 
most dear, by all that is Sacred, come 
not near us. What I wish'd at first I 
swoon at now: a remote Country for 
Silence and Obscurity! why'tis the 
only Place for Tattle and Glaring 
Light: already they are alarm’d at
me; my being dean, and perhaps a 
little different Mein from what they 
are us'd to, has set the Village in a 
murmuring Inquiry: Shou'd God-
like you appear, the whole County 
wou’d be in Uproar. Forbear, My 
Dear, or let your Love think again, 
and contrive some better way. 

Wou'd I cou'd believe you have 
read all my Letters over again, 
as I, were you near me, cou’d convince 

(30)
you I have all yours by heart. This
without opening my Cabinet, '=is the 
first.

Will she then hear me! Oh God, 
what shall I say! I that have writ to 
Queens, now am dumb! Love chokes 
my Words, my Pen drops from my 
trembling hand! Sure this violent
passion brings Death or Distraction!
Either gives me Easem but you can 
give me Heaven, where were thy 
Beauties formed. I will not say more, 
because indeed the rest is Madness. 

Then Corydon, how sweet was the 
first inclining Glance! Lucina led me 
to a new Grove, at our great 
Misresies Palace of ----- She walk’d 
on; I knew the dear Contrivance, nor 
consented, nor resisted, such is the
doubtful Yielding of young Inno-
cence to Love's alluring Charms. You 
came; what eager Blushes fill’d your 
Cheeks! what Fires darted from your 
wishing Eyes! your Sighs were ma-
ny, but your Words were few; short
were the stol'n Minutes; the Impres-
sion lasted ever, evem for ever on

(31)
Clarind's Heart. But then, My Lord,
how long was your Petition? how 
long you whisper'd, Do you not hate 
me? nor wou’d you ever leave till 
you had heard with a true but falter-
ing Tongue, I love you. You caught 
me in your Arms: where for that 
blest moment, where were our Souls? 
Sure mine was fled, and yours just 
trembling at your lips, hover’d on 
my Bosom. Oh Corydon! cease, cease 
to charm me; give my labouring Spi-
rits Ease. Farewel. Contrive some 
other way to see me. 

(32)
LETTER XI.
Corydon to Clarinda.  

And is it possible Clarinda should 
deny her Corydon, the only Sa-
tisfaction of his Life! but you shall 
be obeyed in this and every thing: 
yet I must try how far your Love
will carry you to meet my Wishes;
for oh I grow impatient now to see 
the dear Object of my Soul, Lucina, 
whose desires in some measure run 
with mine as to the seeing you my 
Dear! But oh she cannot wish like me,
because she cannot taste the Pleasures 
you can give! Every Kiss from you
draws my Soul upto my Lips, then
shoots it back with tickling Pleasures 
that runs through every Vein, so dif-
ferent are your Kisses from what I 
ever tasted. I kiss’d Lucina, who wants 
not Charms even so create fond De-
sire in the most rigid Breast, and yet 
’twas tasteless all to me. We have con 


(33) 
triv’d Kensington for your Abode, 
where Lucina has promis’d to be your 
daily Visitor; and in her Company 
I know Clarinda won’t miss her Cory-
don; forgive me, Dearest, I mean when
Business calls him from her Arms, 
which I’ll take care shall be as seldom 
as possible. Let wretched Souls who 
are not capable of this divine Passion, 
labour and groan under the burden 
of State Affairs, I would only have
Clarinda mine. 

Let me know by the next Post, My 
Dear, if you approve of the Place pro-
pos'd, else I’m again unhappy; for it 
is impossible for me to live without 
you: think on that, and then save or 
kill your Corydon. 

I also send My Dear another of of Lu-
cina's Letters, to persuade her to 
what my Soul longs for, your Ap-
roach. 

(34)
LETTER XII. 
Lucina to Clarinda. 

Hang me (My Dear) tho am 
a Widow, if ever I heard so 
much of love before as your Corydon 
fills my Ears with. 'Tis well I dote 
upon Clarinda's Name: I hear it, I
am sure, perpetually; Corydon has got 
a Custom to visit me every day, on-
ly to talk of Clarinda. I never was a 
Confidant till now: but my Love to 
you makes your lover’s Story plea-
sing. 

Pray hasten to us; I am sure all
things are in your power; and why y
ou should let a Passion cool, that may 
redound so much to your Advantage, 
is to me a Miracle.

Iwill tell you more when I see you:
defer not, for what I have to say is 
worth your attention, and as true as 
my Affection to Clarinds and my 
Zeal to serve her. Adieu. 


(35)
Corydob faith we meet next Thurs-
day, which my pleased Eyes' shall 
tell you whether I am glad of or 
no.  

LETTER XIII 
Clarinda to Lucina. 

That which all the happy World 
wou'd rejoice at, gives me 
Grief; for my Prophetick Soul fore-
bodes some future Ill, nor will allow 
me such a Friend and such a Lover: 
perhaps, 'tis the effect: of Solitude, and 
the Spleen, which your beloved fight
may remove. Use no Argument to 
me relating towards Interest: I have 
took an uncommon Romantick way to 
oblige fine Notions, that are remote 
from sublunary things ؛ If these Ideas 
fail, I have no recourse but to Death, n
or no Sanctuary but the Grave. 

(36)
Chide me now,for this is fed melan-
cholly stuff: the Company I love, 
nay I might say adore, may perhaps 
revive my wonted Gaiety: however, 
in all Humours and all Conditions I
am wholly Yours. 

(37) 
LETTER XIV. 
Clarinda to Corydon. 

Why will you tempt me again 
to that Place which of neces-
sity must renew a thousand Reflecti-
ons that will rob Clarinda of her 
Peace. I am grown almost into a 
perfect Stupidity: It is a kind of a 
dead Sea-calm, whole Emotions I am 
scarce sensible of. Your Syrene's Voice 
calls me again amidst the Waves, the 
Rocks, and certain Storms. Methinks 
this second Desire is like your first, 
like the first Lure of Love which shook 
my even Temper, and gave me high-
est Pleasure and highest Pain. If I 
consult my Reason, how often do I 
wish for that soft state of dull Securi-
ty, when all my Care was Dress and 
innocent Divertion? but comes Love, 
my Tyrant and your Friend, that 
whispers o’er our Joys, repeats your 
Vows, your Sighs, and all your Trans-

(38)
ports, I yield, I yield; my rising
Heart owns your Victory, and urges 
me to fly where I may meet those
charming Eyes. 

Ask your Heart numberless Que-
stions, if like mine it has been sin-
cerely true, ne’er let any Idea in but 
mine, or any pleasing Thought but 
Love? This and much more I have 
to do.  I come my Corydon, Clarinda 
comes. 

I send to you my Letter to Lucina;
I told you I shou'd quickly get that 
Assurance. 

(39)
LETTER XV. 
Corydon to Clarinda. 

Wi11 being near your Corydon di-
sturb Clarinda's Quiet? What
means my Love? Were I ill-natur'd 
and splenetick, I shou’d draw strange 
Conclusions from your Scruples, and 
cram my Letter as full of jealous Sus-
picions, as an old superannuated La-
dy of our Acquaintance does to her 
young Gallant: but I know thy 
Soul’s above the common Wickedness 
of being false, and 'tis a glorious Vir-
tue to be true, and such I know thou 
dost possess. Haste then, my Clarin-
da and with thy Smiles chear the 
Heart of thy now almost expiring Co-
rydon. I shall expect you on Thursday 
Night at Lucinda's; I wou’d meet 
you at the Coach were I sure you 
wou’d not chide me; for thou art as 
timerous as a conscious Murderer, 
whole own Shadow frights him. Your 

(40)
Friend is impatient for your coming, 
and my Opinion is, that we shall be 
less suspected here than you seem to 
apprehend. 

Excuse Haste, and believe me to 
be entirely Yours. 

(41)
LETTER XVI 
Clarinda to Corydon. 

I am come to Kensingtons but find n
either Condon nor Lucina: For-
give my Impatiency, which cannot 
live without seeing you. I have dif-
patch'd a Messenger in your Search. 
I may excuse your Absence, for my 
Haste has made me here long before 
the appointed hour. You express 
my Condition alright when you tell 
me I am full of Fears: indeed I am. 
Hope, Love, and Fear of a Censori-
ous World, give me severe Anxieties, 
but your Sight will drive all these 
Cares away. 'Tis Corydon alone can 
bring Peace and Joy to Clarinda. 

(42)
LETTER XVII. 
Corydon to Clarinda.

I Need not tell you, my dear, that 
I have not stir'd out to day, for 
that you may conclude by my not be-
ing at Lucinda's before you: You 
may be sure'tis no small Indisposi- 
tion cou’d keep me within, when by 
going abroad I might purchase the g
reatest pleasure in the World, your 
company. For what Offence I know 
not, Heaven has inflicted this Punish-
ment upon me, except it fears your 
Eyes shou'd rival it, and I became an 
idolater. Let me beg you to be easy 
and contented, as much, I mean, as it 
is possible for you to be, when I am 
from you I hope Lucinda's company 
will in some measure divert my ab-
sence, and make the hours pass more 
agreeable. To Morrow will come, 
my Love, and if I live to see it, I will 
see you, tho' my life shou’d pay the 
price; till then Adieu. 

(43)
LETTER XV.
Clarinda to Corydon.

I Write, my Lord, by Lucina's com- 
mand, to tell youhow we have 
spent the Evening, truly in reading 
all your Letters. Lucina flattts my 
disease, and persuades me you can 
never be unconstant, tho' I have al-
most brought her to my Opinion: 
The soil Letters have most Respect 
and Tenderness; the last, more care-
less and familiar. Sure uniting, the 
Flame shou’d increase it, I'd give the 
world to know, whether my Corydon 
loves me better or worse, since I have 
own’d I love him. Lucina writes the 
next lines, as you see by her hand. 

Better now, but whether he will 
longer for your kindness profess, 
I dare not swear for him; I hope so, tho’ 
Mankind generally after the mighty 

(44)
business of a Conquest is over grow 
Idle, and when they have reached the 
flying fair leave to pursue.

Hear ye that, my Lord:, Clarinda's 
timourous nature creates a thousand 
such apprehensions, this dear Friend 
who over-looks me too too often 
sooths my fears, and fans my flames, 
by calling you excellent and Charm-
ing, Glory of your Sex and Age. 
Oh, my best life, do you never meet 
with the pleasure of hearing me com-
mended, I Court, I dote on your 
praise, but I am fond as artless, in- 
nocence as harmless Maids, who ne-
ver were betrayed. Farewel; to mor-
row Dine with us if you can. 

Lucina's Postcript. 

Oh, happy happy you, sure never 
Man was blest like my Lord ------, 
Clarinda is a little World of Charms:
her Looks, her Will, her Air gives 
me transports, tho’ a Woman; what 

(45) 
then, must you feel; how can you 
forbear, the public testimony of 
your love, and bind her ever to your 
heart, with that Charm which Death 
alone dissolves; 'tis the only won-
der I have in the Affair, that you 
defer. 

(46) 
LETTER XVIII. 
Corydon to Clarinda. 

Just as I receiv'd an Order to at-
tend our great Master to Wind-
for, I got your bllet-doux I know not 
whose properly to call it, for your 
Queries, Answers and Surmises are so 
prettily interwoven, that I know not
who’s the Mistress, who’s the Friend;
that by the way, tho’ Corydon is not 
authentick, for thy heart tells thee 
Clarinda claims the superiority, tho’ 
one would swear Lucina were no stran-
ger to my heart, she knows so well 
its secret thoughts, and you may be-
lieve her, when she tells you I shall 
be for ever constant, for she speaks 
my Sentiments exactly; and as to 
your Question, whether I love you 
better now than before, I answer, 
better, better, a thousand times, and 
the dispute Shall be hereafter who 

(47) 
lov'd most. Now one word to your 
Friend, and then I’ve done, for my 
Coach waits, but all shall wait, till 
you’re answer’d. 

Now, Madam, what shall I lay 
to return your Civility, I can on-
ly wish I had another Heart to of-
fer you, so nearly you resemble 
her who has possession of this, that 
I cou'd never make a better choice, 
and since our Loves are mutual, 'tis 
pitty there shou'd be anything want-
ing to compleat our mutual happi-
ness, but impossibilities are not in 
the reach of Mortals; all that are 
allow’d to us, is but barely wishing, w
hich does but inhance the pain. 
I have ten thousand obligations to 
you; first for your kind thoughts 
of me; secondly, the care you take 
to divert Clarinda, whose pleasure I 
wish equal to my own; and she shall 
never find me wanting in ought that 
may conduce to it. And now La-
dies both, I am sorry I can’t do my
self the Honour of Dining with you 
to day, but I know nothing shall

(48)
hinder the satisfaction to Morrow. 
which I propose in your charming 
Conversation; till when I am, dear 
Clarinda, 

Your Faithful Lover, and 
Lucina's humble Servant. 
Corydon.

(49)
LETTER XIX.
Clarinda to Corydon. 

Nothing but your dear Self cou'd 
be welcomer than your Epi-
stle, which I must say we received 
since my Lucina shared it; but for my 
Life I can't get her to set her Fist to 
this: she vows she won’t: she write 
to a Man ---- no, she scorns it. My 
Lord, Am not I mighty gay? Me-
thinks I am. Ah this Sunshine! 'twill
not last, there is a gloomy Fate, I 
fear, belongs to me. My dear Lu-
cina jogs my hand, and will not let 
me entertain a melancholly Thought. 
Hold ---- what am I talking on? wide 
of the matter: for you must know, 
My Lord, it is absolutely necessary you 
Dine with us to day, because there is 
some delicate, delicate, I won't tell 
you what: come and see. Make 
much of this Note, for I cannot tell 

(50)
where ever you'll such another 
from [redacted].

See what a Blot she's made as I was 
saying Poor Clarinda. 

LETTER XX. 
Corydon to Clarinda. 

This comes to kiss my dear Cla-
rinda's Hand, and tell her I’m 
just wak’d from a very pleasing
Dream: Methought I had got a La-
dy in my Arms, pretty, and witty, 
and kind as my Desires cou’d frame; 
I believe you guess the Person. Duce 
take Imagination, I say ---- for I ne’er 
had more mind to real Substance than 
at present. Now, My Dear, I must 
rise, wash my Mouth, and then drink 
your Healths in Chocolet; and I expect 
to be pledg’d by you two Ladies in Ra-
tifea٠ Hark! methinks I hear that La-

(51)
dy (that wou’d not write to a Man) 
say, What does he take us for? I'll 
rattle, him ---- Prithee Clarinda take
up the Cudgels for me, and tell her 
she must either strictly observe the 
Rules of Quality, or resign her Pre-
tensions to't; for that's a main Ingre-
dient in the competition، Hold --- 
I had like to have forgot Thanks for 
my Entertainment Yesterday, which 
was the best furnish’d Table I ever 
din' d at: Beauty enough to warm an 
Anchorite, Wit enough, to confound a 
Statesman, and good Humour enough 
to baffle the Spleen of a Critick: these 
were the standing Dishes ---- The rest 
I remember were excellent in their 
kind ---- not forgetting the Venison 
which I think was as good as I ever 
eat. If possible, I’ll see you as soon 
as the House breaks up --- but in the 
Evening I won't fail; till when, be-
lieve me 

Your impatient Corydon. 

(52) 
LETTER XXI.
Corydon to Lucina. 

What I left Clarinda to guess 
at, I must explain to you. 
The kind Lady I mention’d was your 
dear Self: wou’d to Jove it had been 
real. According to Opinion of the 
Learned, the Imagination represents 
the Image of things in the Mind, that 
are not present to the Sense; so your 
Image being perpetually in my Mind, 
no wonder that Sleep shou’d bring 
you to my Arms. Oh Lucinda! 'tis 
impoilible for a Heart, tho ne’er so 
well fortified with Resolution, to hold 
out against Beauty irresistible like 
yours. Your Eyes disperse Darts of 
such magnetick Power, that you ne-
ver fail to captivate whoe’er you look 
on. For my part, I own my self 
your Slave; your Wit has charm’d 
my Soul, your Beauty made a per-
fect Conquest o’er my Heart, and 
your good-humour has drawn my 
Inclinations into the Confederacy. 
I’m uneasie when from you, and not 
contented when with you, wanting 
opportunity to tell you how much I 
am, Madam, your passionate Ado-
rer, 

Corydon. 

Shew this to your Friend if you dare.

(54)
LETTER XXII.
Clarinda to Corydon.  

My Lord, Our not coming last night, occa-
sions this Epistle § it is sent thus 
early to prevent such naughty Morn-
ing Dreams, and such bold Billet 
Deux, I allure you Lucina vows ne-
ver to see your Face again: she says 
you are a false, perfidious, barba-
rous ---- I cannot for my heart write 
all the hard Words she thunders in 
my Ears: and this is all forsooth be-
cause you suspected we wou'd be 
such a couple of Errant Lady Errants 
to pledge you in a Cup of Ratesea. 
Well, Corydon, if I make up this mat-
ter you must have a care how you 
offend a second time: tho if I judge 
other Hearts by my own, your Pre-
sence will make ample Satisfaction. 
But setting this Mirth aside, which 
seldom belongs to me my Dear, thou 

(55)
Life of mv Desires, Darling of my 
Days, and constant Image of my
Nights, the perpetual Idea of my 
waking Thoughts, and Angel of my 
working Fancy when lockt in Slum-
bers, then ¿ven then, Beloved, I must 
leave thee again, Fate and Fame, my 
Enemies, thy suppliant Slaves, they 
decree that I muil leave thee, read 
the enclosed and see if I can rest in 
Peace. 

(56)
letter XXIII. 
To Mrs.---- at Kensingcon. 

Madam, 
Do you imagine you can stay 
unobserved near the Court, 
near your Relations, and in the midst 
of an admiring World, who search 
for you as Persians wou’d after the 
Sun, were that obscur’d; retire or else 
appear in Public. Oh, be careful 
how you trust my Lord of --- aand 
be assured it is a Friend that gives this 
Caution. 

Alass, what Friend foe’er it is the 
Advice comes now too late. I have 
ventured ail my flock stove and 
Faith, should you now prove false I 
have nothing left to loose. Oh thou 
unnecessary Friend, all aid is past 
like Pillows to the dying. I may be 
preserved in Torture, but cannot live 
without him. Oh swear again, again 
begin the Tale of Love, or I shall fear 

(57) 
I know not what to fear; forgive 
me Corydon these wild Excursions; 
Lucina knows not the latter part of 
this Letter, I wou’d not disturb her 
or you with my Concerns, for I am 
never, never so happy as when I see 
that faithful Friend and charming Lo-
ver pleased, something I have more 
to tell you, which is not so proper 
to be writ. Adieu. 

(58) 
LETTER XXIV 
Corydon to Clarinda. 

It is impossibie to describe the 
concern thy Letter put me into, 
what damn’d officious Devil this un-
known Friend can be, I can’t guess 
for my Soul, but that it is some im-
plement of Hell I’m certain, for none 
else cou’d be so bold to Caution Cla-
rinda in ought against her Carydon, 
for if there ever were such a thing 
as true Love. I love thee, My Dear,  
what other proof can I give you than 
what I have already, think Clarinda, 
and if there be a thing in the power 
of Corydon to clear the scruples of the 
Woman I adore, ask boldly, and if I 
do it not may you hate me, which 
is the greatest Curse I can invoke on 
the head of your faithful Corydon. 

(59) 
I will wait on you instantly to 
know the Secret, and tell you my 
self how much I am 

Yours. 

I am so intolerably out of humour, 
that I cannot find one Gallant Ex-
pression to your fair angry Friend, in 
faith you are both tormenting Bag-
gages, and that I'll stand by. 

(60)
LETTER XXV. 
Clarinda to Corydon. 

Last Night (my Lord) I well 
remember you made me pro-
mise to tell you this Morning, if my 
Mind and Resolutions were the same: 
Oh! be assured I am not altered for 
all Reflections, but confirm my Opi-
nion. I must go that’s certain, or be 
exposed to what will break my Heart, 
and why should you withstand it; 
you know I go yours, I live but to 
think on you, I rejoyce in nothing 
but my Love to you, which now is 
grown my vital part, and all my 
Health and Peace, and even Life de-
pends upon my Passion. You often 
bid me ask and have, and at the 
same time you know I have no o-
ther with but you; do you propose 
the Method for our Happiness, fix it 
to your unerring Judgement, or be 
Love your Guide. I’ll not submit a-

(61)
lone, that is too poor a Word; no, 
I’ll sacrifice all to make you ea-
sie. Generous Corydon can not use 
Clarinda ill. 

The trusting, charmed, the loving, 
doting, dying, fond Clarinda come 
and help contrive my Journey, the 
time will quickly now run on in swift 
hours of Pleasure unobserved,  if
wants obscure will come, then the 
rugged Traveller Will drag his pinni-
on'd Wings, and each flow beating 
Minutes march seems a long age of 
woe; but I anticipate my Sorrows; 
Joy of my Soul farewel. 

Postscript. 
Lucina is grown shy, and will not 
help me out. My Letters, I fear wants 
sprightliness to please a Man of your 
Fire, my love is fierce as yours, that’s 
all I boast of, Adieu.

(62)
LETTER XXVI.
Corydon to Clarinda. 

Must I propose the Method 
to create and fulfil our Hap-
piness? then let it be to love for e-
ver, for sure there is no Bliss beyond 
it, for where two Hearts are bound by 
mutual Love, no petty Quarells dare 
intrude, or causeless Jealousies destroy 
their Quiet; Love and Honour are 
the only tyes upon our Actions, and 
he that breaks either of them will 
have no regard to Laws, we have 
had but too many Presidents late-
ly, in England the Power of the 
Parliament suppasses that of the 
Church. Be assured, my Dearest, 
that I Love and I do no more know 
the time when I shall not do so, than 
when I shall dye. Believe me, and 
take care of your self, and me in you. 
If you are bent upon going, 1 will see 
you to Night, tho’ if, you might be 

(63)
prevail’d upon to stay till Tuesday, I 
would beg to be excused till to Mor-
row Morning, since some Affairs of 
Consequence require my attendance 
upon his M----у in his Closet this 
Evening; but if Clarhda Commands 
all things shall be defer'd for her. 

Postscript. 
Answer per Bearer, that I may 
take my Methods according.

(64)
LETTER XXVII 
Corydon to Lucina. 

What Construction does the
fair Lucinda think I have 
put upon her concealing my Letter 
from Clarinda --- Why Faith ---
That I am not indifferent to her ---
Pardon my Vanity, hut you can't in
reason deny me the liberty of making 
the best Interpretation for my Love 
I can, since to have a share in your 
esteem is the utmost extent of my 
Desires, and the hopes of once ac-
quiring it is the only comfort of my 
Life. Oh Madam, cou’d you but 
conceive the disorder of my Heart
when I’m oblig’d to caress one for 
whom I find my Flame declining, and 
at the same time to entertain another 
which I know Tm Fated to adore, 
with cold complasance or artful Gal-
lantry. I am almoit mad --- I have 
just writ a short Letter to Clarinda, 

(65)
which I suppose you'll see, for my 
part I have with the greatest violence 
imaginable forc'd my self to write 
kindly to her, Dissembling is not my 
Tallent, and 'tis with the greatest 
regret in the World that I'm oblig’d 
to practice it, and I am so much a 
lover of plain dealing, that 1 fear 
she'll quickly discover the Imposture.

I was under some Apprehensions 
that Lucinda was the Person that had 
caution’d Clarinda; but since I saw 
her my Sufpitions are chang’d, and I 
look upon it as a happy Omen in 
driving her into the Country, to make 
room for my humble Addresses to the 
dear Lucinda, which in spight of her 
coldness Corydon will perform. 

If you value the well being of a 
Person prefers you to all Confidera-
tions whatsoever, send one Line to 
your faithful Slave. 

(66)
LETTER XXVIII. 
Clarinda to Corydon. 

The three Words I sent by your 
Messenger, tells you I Obey, 
your desire in my stay till Tuesday; 
but having past an Evening without 
seeing you or Lucina, sure I cannot 
employ it so much to my Satisfact-
on as Scribling to you first, I wou’d 
ask you wheher you think your 
self or Lucina happier than I, you 
make a Celebrated Figure, so does 
she; you give and receive Visits, 
have Circles, Levees, Ruells, she the 
same; I the perfect Devotee to Love 
and Solitude quit all this Grandeur, 
lost in Thought, feeding on Contem-
plation, catch but now and then a 
gleam of Bliss, and fondly think I 
am over-paid. Oh Corydon! why 
do you talk to me of Church or Par-
liaments. I study nought but Love, 
my Soul, that Heavenly spark, form- 

(67)
ed by enligntening Fire, but then in 
Bounds confined, and darkly sent in 
quest of Happiness, centers all its 
Joys in you, nor mounts to the Ce-
lestial Orb from whence the Inspira-
tion came. Whoever is a perfect 
Lover can never bean Atheist; oh! 
they will find there’s something more, 
much more, both in their Pains and 
Transports than a Mechanick Engine, 
plain Nature, like its fellow Brutes, 
cou’d feel; give them ye Powers but 
one Moment my wrack of thought, 
or my Delight, and they'll soon con-
fess the Immortal part. I shall be 
punished for this I know. I shall, 
but I'll go on tho’ inevitable ruin waits 
me. 

I humbly conceive you think me 
mad, I am so, and I'll indulge it, I'll 
Love till I have forgot all other use 
of Life, still dote on my prize, my 
blest, happy, lovely and beloved; 
thus will I talk, and rave, and write, 
time shall unheeded pass, the labour-
ing Spirits, when worn out with 

(68) 
mighty Agitation, then will cease to 
work and all this violent Passion be 
forgot. Am I not happy now I 
think I have been in the upper Re-
gion. Adieu, come and reclaim me 
from Romances, you have not usu-
ally these flights from Clarinda. 

(69)
LETTER XXIX.
Lucina to Corydon. 

Sure inch an Example of Falsehood 
no Age can Parallel, make love to 
me Clarinda's Bosom Friend, write to 
me, well never be alone one Minute, 
it must be other Peoples Fates only 
can preferve you, Houses, Churches, 
nay, I beleive, the very Sky wou’d 
fall upon you if caught at conveni-
ent distance from Mankind; what 
vile Interpretation did you put upon 
my concealing your Persidy from 
Clarinda; no, no naughty Man ’twas 
my fear to disturb that Charming F
riend, else I had thrown 'em at her 
Feet immediately, and stamt upon 
'em; I beleive that you depend up-
on that Graceful Person, Mein and 
Gallantry to conquer all Hearts that 
run the dangerous risque of conver-
sing with you; but I will arm my 
self with Friendship, Gratitude and 

(70) 
Justice, these shall for ever against all 
your powerful Actacques preserve 
the incensed Lucina. 

LETTER XXX.
Corydon to Clarinda. 

Beleive me Clarinda, business ne-
ver sat more heavy on my Soul 
than last Night, a thousand times I 
wish’d my self with you, if I am 
thus restless now you are near me, 
what shall I be when you are gone. 
I know not what’s the matter with 
me, but I am grown uneasie of late, 
methinks I’m never pleas'd but when 
I am in your Apartment at Kensing-
ton; I grow weary of the fatigue-
ing Affairs of State, and wou’d be
glad of a retreat free from Court, 
and all its flattering Greatness, in 

(71)
some lonely Cell with her I love. 
Oh Clarinda, pity me for I am now 
in need of pity; I cou’d curse every 
bar to my happiness, wou’d cursing 
do; but when I confider all things 
will have an end, I know there is no 
lasting Pleasure on this side the 
Grave, this thought arms me with 
resolution to endure the utmost
frowns of Fortune, whilst you are 
well and happy Corydon can bear 
them all.

I'll see you in the Evening. 

(72)
LETTER XXXI. 
Corydon to Lucina. 

Your very Anger is so charming 
that I must offend again, to be 
again Chstis’d, I shall not endea-
vour to clear my self of ought you 
are pleas’d to lay to my charge, but 
plead guilty to each Particular, and 
throw my self upon the Mercy of 
my Judge, who can't in Conscience 
punish me, being in a great measure 
the occasion of my Crime; had you 
been less Charming, I had been more 
Constant to Clarinda; your putting 
me in mind of Judgments, I vow, 
makes me tremble least they should 
reach you, for Heaven never suffers 
Murderers to go unpunished, perhaps 
you smile at all the Mischiefs which 
your Eyes commit, and cry the Act is 
not yours, but let me tell the cruel 
Fair, pretended Ignorance will be no 
Plea in Loves Court of Judicature. 

(73)
I can’t help laughing at your reli-
gious scruple; for my part I'm too 
good a Protestant to think Heav
will punilh us Mortals for persuing 
its own Decrees; and lay you what 
you please, I shall never b brought 
to believe, ought but a divine Inspi-
ration in my Love for you: There-
fore, Madam, spight of your Resolu-
tions, I will hope, nor is it possible 
you shou’d lay any claim Grati-
tude or Justice, whilst you are deaf 
to the sute of your Admirer. 

(74)
LETTER XXXIV.   
Clarinda to Corydon.

Sure my Charming Cory bor-
rowed that melancholly Expres-
sion from his thoughtful Clarinda, to 
meditate either on disappointments, 
or the last period of our Ambition, 
Love and Care: The Grave suits not 
the gay, happy Corydon, whose Soul 
is so disposed and adapted to his love-
ly form, that ail his Actions move 
east, and incline to an agreeable 
mirth and harmony, then his Manly 
reason frees him from all the little 
fears our Sex is subject to. I, most 
timorous of my Kind, am doubting 
still, and frighting my Repose a-
way. 

Last Night, wearied with thought, 
parting indeed was the sad Theam; 
sleep came to my relief, but, oh, 
my Dream distracted me; methought 
my better Angel came, I saw the love-
ly Boy, his shining Looks confirmed 

(75) 
him, more than mortal, resplendent 
Glory filled the room, for my fancy 
worked me even where I realy was 
silent with Fear and Awe; after a tune-
ful found I heard, I thought I heard 
distinctly these words in a Voice as 
soft as Corydon's, When first he whis-
pered Love; ah, thou fond, foolish fair, 
whose Heart was made too soft for thy 
more rugged fate; awake from the be-
witching Lethargy of Love, and lift thy 
Eyes to brighter glories. At this he 
spread his silver Wings, and darting 
Beams of dazzling Brightness, that my 
weak Eyes cou’d scarce persue the 
wondrous tract of Light; yet I did, 
and there beheld a glorious Troop in 
distant Air. I heard dissolving Me-
lody, my Ears catch’d imperfectly 
the sound, yet the Words seem’d 
these: He is false ؛ and fair Clarin- 
da’s ours. That Accent, tho' divine, 
waked me, with terrour I called a-
loud on thee, protested thou wert 
true, and contradicted all the amaz-

(76) 
ing Vision. Hast to me, my Love, 
and if thou canst not Swear new 
Oaths, run o’er all the old, that I 
may ne’er, tho' Angels speak it, be-
lieve that Corydon can be false to his 
Clarinda. 

(77)
LETTER XXXV.
Corydon to Lucina.

I can no more help writing to the 
fair Lucina, than she can making 
Conquests where’er she comes. You 
are mistaken if you think your silence
will make me desist--No-, I'm resolv’d 
to proceed let what willattend. For-
tune still favours the Bold, and only
Cowards fly their ground; whole 
Souls are incapable of glorious Acti-
ons, I cannot fear, having Love and 
Honour for my guard; Love bids me 
hope, and Honour pleads my Cause; 
and Lucina must be more than cruel
to refuse 'em both. Tell me no more 
of your friendship to Clarinda, least I 
turn your own Argument upon you; 
for do you think she’d kiss the hand, 
that kills the Man she loves? To 
show your friendihip to her, be kind 
and pitty me; I will not leave to per-
secute you, till in pure compaission to
your self you condescend to hear me. 

(78)
It was not without the greatest vio-
lence to my inclination, that I heard
the tender fights, law the melting 
Tears, you paid Clarinda at parting, 
I grew Jealous of every look, and 
tho' she is Woman I envied her the 
blessing; nay, now, the very Idea of 
it distracts me; write, Madam, or 
my passion will hurry me to your A-
partment; nay more, perhaps force 
me to declare my Flame, tho' a thou-
sand Eyes were by. I wait the re-
turn of my Servant with your An-
swer, which make happy, or 
miserable, Madam, 

Your ladyship devoted Slave, 
Corydon.

(79) 
LETTER XXXVI. 
Lucina to Corydon. 

Are the most excellent of Man-
kind still the falsest, when Na-
ture gives every other Grace? Does 
she purposedly omit Truth and Con-
stancy? Can Corydon forget his Clarin-
da, the softest Maid, the Gentlest 
Kindest Fair, that ever yet was form-
ed? Is she not Young, Beautiful and 
Good as Angels are? Can ye forget
her Love, her Faith, her Tenderness, 
with what a lost regard she viewed her
Corydon at partin; her lovely Eyes 
seem'd to ask it he wou’d still be True,
but he is False, Forsworn: Oh, who 
shall whisper the Tale to her; may 
no officious Tongue ever reveal the 
perjured Story: Methinks I am guil-
ty too, and conscious of yours, I 
dare not write to my Clarinda. I 
charge ye, Corydon, return to your first 
Vows, and this one erring step, this 
just growing falsehood shall be as se-

(80)
cret as the flames in Urns, whole 
sickly fires are never seen by mortal 
Eyes; but if you persist, what can 
ye hope, inevitable mine follows; 
ruine on poor Clarinda, your self and 
me. 

(81)
LETTER XXXVII. 
Clarinda to Corydon. 

What! a Post gone, and no 
news from Corydon: Us he 
not well? Or is he careless grown? 
Either is a tormenting thought; thou 
Blessing of my days do not forget 
me. Crown my solitude with thy 
dear Letters, and I am Content. Is 
that so much? Yet that is all I ask; 
I know my Love has business attend-
ing that great Monarch, who always 
smiles upon him. I know it is a 
world of care: Thus do I frame Ex-
cuses for thee. Oh, I must for my 
own Quiets sake, for shou’d I once 
believe neglect the cause my grief 
wou’d know no bounds, I soon shou'd 
grow the Image of despair, my wan 
Cheeks and languid Eyes wou'd fright 
the fools that are so eager now to 
gaze; away disponding fears my 
Love is Constant, his Vows are true, 

(82)
his passion all unchanged sincerity; me 
thinks, somthing crys hold Clarinda, 
he’s a Man, and Men are all by Na-
ture false, let 'em be so my Corydon, 
not made of the course fluff, the rest 
were formed, he is Angelical and 
all Divine, write to me then, and 
chase my Melancholly Dreams, to 
guilty Bosomes, let not mine be the 
Mansion, for Love, even the God of 
Love be filled with what Love flys dis-
pair, tell my Lucina, she’s unkind, tell 
her I love her next my Corydon adieu. 

(83)
LETTER XXXVIII.
Corydon to Lucina. 

Cease cruel Fair thus to torment 
me, why do you call my 
remembrance the only things I wou’d f
orget, yet this pleads for me, I ne-
ver wronged Clarinda, and now repent 
I ever lov’d her. She is indeed 
all you can say, nay she has Charms 
might fix Inconstancy it self, but 
yours surmount, Heaven knows I 
have strove against this growing 
flame, arm’d my self with resolution 
to suppress it; but the more I en-
deavour’d to stifle it, the more fierce 
it burn’d; so that concluding the
hand of Providence was in’t, I ven-
tur’d to declare my Passion. Oh! 
Lucina, be merciful, as you are fair 
and destroy not my hopes with such 
severe Reflections. Suffer me to ap-
pear before you, which I dare not do 
without your leave, so absolute is 
your Command over your dispair-
ing Slave. 

(84)
LETTER XXXIX.
Corydon to Clarinda.

Yours I receiv’d my Dear, and can 
just tell you I am well, but so 
hurried up and down, that I cou’d 
scarce find time to write this short 
Letter: You must not be uneasy, 
my Dear, at missing of a Post, two, 
or three, opportunities does not al-
ways offer, and a Man wou’d not 
forfeit his Reputation upon so trivial a
Concern as that of a Letter: I will 
allow you to write every Post who 
have nothing else to do; but for me 
who you are sensible have a Thousand 
things to employ my thoughts, you 
must forgive unlucky Business; once 
a Week, at least, you shall not fail; 
if I have leisure, oftener: For you 
may be allured I shall miss no Oppor-
tunity, since my time’s not spent any
where so much to my satisfaction as 

(85)
when writing to Clarinda, whose ve-
ry humble Servant I am. 

POSTSCRIPT.
I have not seen Lucina, nor don’t 
know when I shall; you had best 
write to her your self, perhaps she 
stands upon Punctilioe’s, and ’tis you
Duty to write first. 

(86)
LETTER XL.
Clarinda to Corydon.

Such comfort as some Mother 
felt, when her only Son, the 
darling Heir of Kingdoms died, (can 
I add a greater simiie) such Comfort 
did your Letter bring. Is it a trif-
ling concern to preserve my Life, for 
of that consequence your Letters are. 
What will become of me? Oh, I am 
sinking down apace, my Melancholly 
fancy form’d this sad Idea long ago.
'Tis not my Fortune sinks me, but
'tis you, I scarce believ’d what I read, 
but thought my Eyes mistaken: 
They, alas, convinc’d me those well 
known characters are yours. Be 
silent rather then write so to me; my 
Soul is great as thine, nor is my 
Birth inferior: Think not I have no-
thing else to do, for if you have left 
me I have great Affairs both with 
Heaven and Earth. 

(87) 
First I have a cause to plead with 
Heaven, my Youth, my Innocence, 
which the just Powers will sure for-
give, and save than a noble Family; 
they’l not deny me refuge. 

What pettish anger does my folly 
raise, I have no refuge but in thee, be-
cause I will have none, but do not 
use me so, least you repent too late, 
and never find in all your search of 
Love, such another doting Fool as 
your Clarinda. 

(88)
LETTER XLI. 
Clarinda to Lucina. 

Happy Lucina, if thou knowest
not Love, shou'd I send thee 
a Copy of Corydon's last Epistle, sure 
thy Friendship wou’d join with me to 
Curse Mankind: But why do I com-
plain of him, I am by all abandoned, 
Lucina has lost the remembrance 
of the Wretch that lov’d her. Oh, 
ill repaid in Love and Friendship, 
what I have now to wish is, that 
you may meet a happier fate, a
Swain, if possible, more lovely, and tru-
er far than Cory don: But as I said to 
him, so will I repeat to you, you 
cannot find a Friend more faithful 
than Clarinda. 

(89) 
LETTER XLII.
Lucina to Corydon. 

I Have found your ill natur’d pur-
pose by my dear Clarinda's Let-
ter; how dare you be so unkind to 
her, and have the Confidence to 
believe I shall entertain one good 
Thought of you. I give you leave 
to come and see me, only that we may 
talk of her, that I may convince you, 
never any Women loved you more 
than she does, or deserved you better. 
Had it been my fate to have look’d 
upon you without injuring my Friend, 
I shou’d have thought you the moust 
amiable of Mankind; but that con-
sideration renders you the most de-
test’d. I am angry at the perverse-
ness of our fate which scarce allows 
me to say civilly, Adieu. 

POSTSCRIPT. 

I write to her this Post, I allure
you, but what to say Heaven knows. 


(90)
LETTER XLIII. 
Lucina to Clarinda.

Stupified with Sorrow for the loss 
of your dear Society, I thought 
I shou’d never have brought my self 
into the Power of exercisng any fa-
culty. I am sure, now I endeavour. 
I fhafl infinitely fall short of expres-
sing my ardent Affection to my 
charming Clarinda: If the Men are 
false, their own perfidiousness be 
their Punishment. Let us Love on. 
I have oftentimes a mind to come 
down to you, for there are things 
which I cannot، at this distance, tell 
you, that troubles extremely your 
everlasting Friend Lucina.

(91) 
LETTER XLIV. 
Lucina to Corydon. 

My Lord, 
Last Night being vexed at your
Addressess, and fond of my 
Friend, I have sent her something
by this Post I fear will too much 
disturb her. Pray do you write a 
kind Note, to remove her suspicions 
and fears: Do this as you wou’d 
oblige one you profess more too 
than the wishes, unless circumstan-
ces were otherwise. You know 
who I mean, farewell, learn to be 
constant. and then before you shall 
be esteemed by Lucina.

(92)
LETTER XLV.
Corydon to Clarinda.

Had Clarinda been in London I 
shou'd have sworn she was 
just come from seeing the Fall of A-
lexander when she writ this Letter; 
'tis so larded with Romantick flights. 
Prethee call back thy Reason whilst 
in fight, least it out slip thy reachs. 
Your Fears are all as false as they 
are unreasonable. What if the hurry 
of Business won’t permit me to write 
every Post, must it then follow of 
necessity, that you have lost me? In-
deed Clarinda you displease me with 
your Fears, and if you shou’d find 
what you seem sooften to suspect, 
blame your self for it; for as nothing 
engages a Man of Honour so much 
as a generous Confidence, so nothing 
nettles him more than a perpetual 
distrust; why shou'd you anticipate y
our Grief, stay till you find me 

(93) 
false, as a witness of your Love be 
easie and contented, which is the 
only way to secure your Corydon. 

LETTER XLVI.
Corydon to Lucina

I am sorry I can't obey the charm-
ing Clarinda in every thing, I’m 
sure ’tis my desire to do so, but when 
she commands things so unreasonable 
I must disobey her, as I would the 
Gods themselves, (as Lisimachus says)
Ah Madam! why wou'd you 
make a Villain of me? Why shou'd 
I counterfeit a Passion where I have 
none, no tender one I mean, doubt-
less I have a friendship for Clarinda, 
and shall have to my Lives end, but 
the better part of me is wholly de-
voted to the Divine Lucina; why 
wou’d you disturb your Friend, whose 
Repose you seem so much concern’d 
for, if you have said ought that may 

(94) 
disquiet her in your last Letter, ’tis 
fit you contradict it by an other, but 
that as you please, for my part my 
Conscience will be clear; 'tis ho-
nourable Love I make to you, and 
Marriages were made in Heaven you 
know. Thus far I’m sure I'm in the 
right; now wou’d any reasonable 
Man think me mad, that after having 
obtain’d leave to wait on my Mistress, 
I shou’d stay to write to her? True, 
but what has Reason to do with 
Love? Nothing at all, --- and yet it 
has too, for 1 have a great deal of 
reason in writing this Letter, by 
which I hope to prevent a Thousand 
Interogotaries about Clarinda, which 
I protest neither to hear nor answer 
one, but every syllable you mention 
of her shall entitle me to a kiss; there-
fore Madam, proceed as you please with 

your devoted Corydon. 


(95) 
LETTER XLVII.
Clarinda to Corydon.  

I will no more trouble you with 
my Fears, I alone was born to 
suffer, and so will with such a Resig-
nation bear my woes, till I shame my 
severer Destiny, and make the World 
against its Nature, Laws, and settled 
Practive own I have, been very hard-
ly used. 

Oh why did not this Almighty
business press thus hard upon your 
Heart in the first persuit of Love, let 
an Impartial Judge consider, and in 
appearance you then had more than 
now, your Fortunes and your Ho-
nours were but growing ripe, your 
great Master had no other Favourite, 
the first is sure fulfilled, Ambition is 
satisfied, and the desire of Wealth 
is gorged, the King can live some 
hours without you too, all are plea-
sed, only Love and I complain; where 
are now the soft Expressions, the be-

(96)
witching Language that engaged my 
unwary Heart, then I was your little 
Cherub, the Angel Heaven had sent 
to bless your days, and give a taste 
of Joys Immortal; this and a Thou-
sand Words more tender filled your 
Letters in the gay blooming hour of 
Love, when the least scrip from 
me, wou'd set your Pen a flowing, 
till Sheets were covered with excessive 
Passion. Now, oh sad reverse, I may 
unheeded blot long Pages with my 
Truth, my Vows, and unregarded 
Love. 

Of what use is my undoing? to 
warn my Sex signifies no more than 
all dire Examples do that went be-
fore. I knew in History, in Poems, 
in many a melancholly tale of Truth 
how false Men were, yet I believed, 
trusted, doted, and am I fear undone, 
nay, even you perhaps may charm 
some easie Fair, tho' she shou'd 
know our Story, for Women too 
often think they may secure that Lo-
ver on which some sad forsaken 
Nymph exclaims. 

(97)
My Woman (when I will hear 
her) daily tells me how she meets 
with nothing but Praises of my Beau-
ty, what desires I'd but vouchsafe to
bless their Eyes sometimes, then I 
fly to my Glass, ask that If I am 
still so fair and young to catch all
Gazers, why Corydon's Flame re 
bates nor Courts nor Dyes as he was 
wontfor his Clarinda. Oh, there is 
a mighty reason, tho' a most ungrateful 
one, I am his already and careless of 
the Conquest which with toil he 
won, his Heart grows fond of new 
perfuits. I said I wou'd no more 
distuch you with my Fears, but 'tis 
impossible, they are inseparable to 
one who loves like me, forgive and 
love me if you can, if nor remember 
poor Clarindei dyes. 

(98)
LETTER XLVIII. 
Clarinda to Lucina. 

Since I had yours, which I confess 
alarmed me, tho' if I may ven-
ture to charge what my Soul loves, 
Lucina, with a Crime, I think she 
writes too darkly for that dear Friend
I took her for, for if you know my 
Corydon false tell me the Particulars, 
'twill be Charity to let me dye a-
pace, such a wretch should not linger 
long in pains, in pains excessive, so 
mine sure will prove; but as I 
said before; since I received yours I 
had another from Corydon, much of 
the same stamp, a little soften’d, 
but oh too haughty for my soft Temper. 
Ah my Lucina! I perceive he that 
was my Slave in the first Reign of 
Love, is grown my Lord and Ty-
rant now; well let my Ruin caution 
thee, believe not Man, not for his 
Oaths, his Tears, his Prayers de-

(99) 
jected dying Eyes, nor all the trains 
he lays to intrap our weaker sex, ei-
ther with me renounce 'em all, or 
Marry for lntereft only, where Love 
is hardly, ever named, but only
Joyntures Settlements, and all 
bartering Trade, the prudent
Practice; then you will never talk 
and rave like me, count like me the ٠
Midnight hours, and wake and watch
till Morning; but why do I pretend
to give Advice, who want my self 
Council and Comfort, Farewel. Write 
to me if you love me, if you do not
let me be at once forsaken of all the 
World I value, and I'll soon forsake
the rest. Adieu my Dear, my only 
Comfort. 

(100)
LETTER XLIX.
Lucina to Corydon. 

My Lord, I think I cannot better answer last 
Nights pressing Conversation, than 
by sending dear Clarinda's Letter, 
which is just now in my Hand. I 
cou'd not read it without wet Eyes, 
if you can, sure I with her may call 
you Barberous; Can you after this 
desert such Goodness, and after that 
think I’ll receive your Apostate 
Vows? Well, if you can you are a
bold Man, the Sin lies at your 
Door, I hope to have no hand in it. 
I think Repentance your only way 
to Happiness; if you are obstinate I 
shall pray for Grace to continue to
as well as you, I know you are a 
Traytor, a false Ingrate to Love and 
Clarinda; therefore you shou'd expect
nothing but hate from 

(101)
LETTER L.
Corydon to Clarinda

'Tis much past the power of 
frail Humanity to judge of 
Futurity, Madam, cou’d we set a 
bound to our Passions, and limit their 
Motions by certainty, we might set a 
rule to our Lives, and so prevent
Providence which delights to show 
its Power by disappointing our firm-
est Intentions, I did and do resolve 
to love you, but cannot keep up to
that effeminate fondness which I 
perceive you expect. I shall be al-
ways ready to serve you in the qua-
lity of a Friend, as much as ever, 
which Passion I think preferable to
Love, I'm sure at least 'tis the most 
lasting of the two, and if you'll
come to Town, I'll be one of your
Visitors if you pleaie to let me know 
your Days of Audience, and if you 

(102)
will promise to return the Obligati-
on I should be very proud to receive 
you. 

'Tis true Ambition is fatisfy'd, the 
King is satisfy'd, all are satisfy’d but 
you, which shews that to satisfie 
Clarinda is beyond the Art of Co-
rydon. 

(103)
Letter LI.
Corydon to Lucina.

What Man is there on Earth 
that has not sometime do 
what might pull immediate Ven-

d Letter to Mr. V — ־ containing a jbort Defence of Aristotle., in omfition to a moderndifaurfe on Comedyy C. 
sm 
iwiih you may find the Task you impose on mo of any use to you, then I shall have no reason to complain of the Trouble; but I believe you are the only Man that ever read Aristotle, that had the ihadovv of a Reason againu anything he has laid m his Foeticks. You may reply, that the author of the Short difcourfe^ho fo rigorously attaques him, muil without queilion have read him over, and if fo, that then you are not the only Person that dislikes him after reading. I muss beg yours and the author’s pardon too, if I am apt to believe that you have ]both forgot him, be״ 
cause( 
() 
cause you both meddle not with one Word that he says, excepting the Limey of Time, Place and Action, which if you remember Aristotle is neither the only nor the chief part of his Book. ■ ؟ 
If I were inclin’d to Anftver this Gentleman that is io severe upon this Philosopher, Critic, and Poet: I could ealfily demonstrate the uncon cluiiveneis of his Arguments; but I shall content my self with a bare Vindication of Arifiotle, and leave you and your Friend in the full erijoy״ ment of your own peculiar Opinions. 
And in deference to you, I will fuppoie that out of some Ancient Ma ٠ nufcrips unknown to the rest of the World, you have recover’d that Book of Aristotle's that treated of Comedy, and which has been invisible above these ifoo Years to all the diligent Enquirers after it. If you have done this the Learned World will be extremely oblig’d to you, if you communicate it to them; and the Square 
Caps 
Caps themfeives freely fogive both your Pleaiantrie upon them, and that for aprefent your selves have fo little an esteem for. -٠, .... ...٠٠·.·*٠' 
But if in reality you have not recover’d this Piece, really the misfor tune is fo much the greater, because all, you have both said, is directed a. gainst. a thing that is not in Rerun Naturay and you unmercifully treat Aristotle as a Scoundrel Delinquent, without a pojhbility of knowing his Guilt, or what he says to deserve your Anger; For the truth on t is. Sir we know not one Word of the Matter; and Aristotle for all that appears؛ to the contrary may be: as innocent of what he's accus’d, ؛; of as the ٠ Author himself, for except two or three Chapters, all the Paeticks of ARISTOTLE, that, remain, treat wholly of Tragedy, and that in fo clear and de monilrative a manner, that, tis beyond a poilibility of confuting by Reaion one Rule he advances.. But as for Comedy and Epic Poeiie, we have not fo much left of it as can persuades 

US هء Imagine it ب - -, pliment 
rite, Homer, or 0؟ Arijlophanes; for Tragedy, notthiepopee, vvashisdar.: lingjio III a Courtdid a manoflearn ing make to that great Prince. 
Some Critics are of Opinion, that Horace took all that he says of co medy his ء of Poetry йот this Book thatis lost of ariflotle*s, grant, ing that to me, 'twould not be imper tincnt to examine whether that which Horace advances on that Subject will not 'hold goodas weli here in £٠جر lane) as at Athens and Rome) and then when we .have done fo, Idare appeal to your selves, your own Judgments, whether it would or not. Ard if this befojwhy have you taken. ٠' such pains to abuie a Man of'your own Opinion. / 
I perceive by the Modern authors Second .Draught of a Play, he, would have some Order, dependance, and Decorum in a Play, and. that he does not think Confusion the greatest Ex. eellence of Modern Comedy, if then 
ء:;; ١ he 
he had diílik’d that Model he supposes Ar'jtotle has given us, why has he not given us one more reafonable.and more adapted to the English Stage?, Tis true he owns that we may have a Play call’d a History of the World from the Creation down to Lewis the XIV and the Scene Europe, Asia, a frica, and Americay with equal Pro. bability, as zd hours, and Qovent garden and its purlieus, ٠ yet by his a. vowing his pra¿fice to be contrary to Liberty, we may imagine he believes within himself, that a more Conscionable Compass is more Eligible. 
I lhallpafs over a Remark obvious enough in this Letter, that, a״ great part is built by the Author on a supposition of Artftotle's being no Poet, which muit fall to the Ground, when in the Advertifcment quoted from Scaliger, he tells us of an admirable Fragment of Poetry of that Philofo. pher’s; nor will? insist on an other miitake of this gentleman’s, that all the other Philoiophers had a touch at Poetry, dividing it into I don’t know 
how. 
(Ns 
how many Parts, c, when the Wit of them all amounted not to one of Martial's Epigrams; first he miitake£, that all the Philofbphers had a touch at Poetry in the fence he means it; for none but Aristotle have left us any Treatise of that Art ؛ next I dare be poittrve there is more Wit to be col״ leered out of the whole number of Philosophers, than will make two of Martial's Epigrams, if not more; for I won’t be fo Dogmatical as thisgen״ tleman. 
But to observe all the miftakesof this Letter, and re&ifie them aslbme would do, would be to fill a much larger Volume than that which contains that Letter. I ihali only assure him, that Regularity is not an Enemy to Variety, as the Silent Woman, the Fox, and the Alchymifl of Ben Johnson may teilifie, and that the Irregular Authors have not been the support of the Stage, as t\\qorphan, All for Love, ve nzceprejerv a9 vainly pretend, and some others may prove. On the contrary the moil: regular Pieces of the other Poets please not. And 
( Ho) 
And now I ihatll only give you a taste of what Horace says of Comedy, * and desire die Author to tell the World which of the Rules he has left us, is not of use for a Modern Comedy ev n in Drury-lane, and add only one Familiar Qaeilroniobe Answered at the same time, Whether there benny difference betwixt Comedy and Farce. and what that difference is?

To begin With the igil Horace ad. vises a Learned Imitator or Poet to consult the Life. and thence draw what he has to٠iay. Look youithere is the gentleman’s confu Iting thepoct, x&c. Aristotle therefore is not fo much too blame as he imagines if Horace has copy <1 him, since he Is exactly of our Modern Authors Opinion. He tells us before, that the Poet must make his Dramatic Persons speak according to their Quality, Age, and Nation; that a Shepherd, a Man of Quality, a Frenchman, and a Bramin of the Eafl Indies should not talk all alike, without any diflindion of. Character. This our Magnify d shake fpear has obferv’d, one of his chief Excellencies ؛ being his distinction of chara&er, and I believe this Gentleman would not think it proper that 'Dzcke, in the Trip, Should speak like Sir Harry Wild air, c.
